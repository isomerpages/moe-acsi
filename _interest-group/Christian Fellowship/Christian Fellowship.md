Christian Fellowship (CF) is an interest group organized by a group of like-minded students for students like yourselves. It provides a platform for students to come together to worship, pray and fellowship as a body of Christ. The group meets weekly for fellowship and bible study. To encourage students in their journey of faith, they meet and share in their small groups or cells. In addition, students meet to pray with each other and commit the day to the Lord.

Other than the weekly meetings, the Christian Fellowship is also involved in organizing school-based activities including AC Night of Worship (ACNOW), Religious Emphasis Week (REW) and the annual Christian Fellowship Camp/Conference. ACNOW is an annual event organized by the Christian Fellowship where the whole school family comes together to sing praises and worship God.  An evangelistic event to reach out to students who have not heard the gospel is conducted over three days during the Religious Emphasis Week (REW). In order to build a strong relationship with God, all CF members are encouraged to attend the Christian Fellowship Camp/Conference which is usually held over a few days. Other than games and bonding activities, time is also set aside for the believers to “soak” in God’s presence.

If you are interested to find out more about the CF or if you have any questions about the faith, Christian Fellowship welcomes you with open arms. We love to have you join us and simply, just come as you are!  Look for the Christian Ministry Staff or any of the CF members if you would like more information.
