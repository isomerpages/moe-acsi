<p><strong>2023 Inter-JC Staff football tournament</strong></p><p>11 of our staff members represented the school in the annual Inter-JC staff football tournament held at Victoria Junior College on 11 October 2023.</p><p>Despite the sweltering heat and lingering haze, the determined team collected twice as many points than 2022 - bagging 6 goals in the process as well. In our final game against Jurong Pioneer JC, the team found their shooting form, delivering 3 goals in a span of 6 minutes. Despite JPJC’s attempts to salvage the game till the final second, our team’s disciplined defence shone through and the game concluded with a nail-biting score of 3-2.</p><p>Our preparation for next season starts now and we will seek to do even better in 2024 as the best is certainly yet to be.</p><p>Mr Davin Tan Shun Chong</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture19.jpg"></div><p>Our shining stars</p>
