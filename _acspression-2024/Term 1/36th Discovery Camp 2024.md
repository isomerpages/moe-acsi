<p><strong>36th Discovery Camp 2024</strong></p><p><strong>The Year 1s received a rousing welcome to the school on 2 January, commencing their six-day Discovery Camp. Led by their enthusiastic seniors, they were inducted into the rich and time-honored culture of our school.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our Year 1 students <strong>thoroughly relished</strong> the camp, <strong>forging deeper connections</strong> with both the school and their classmates. They <strong>embarked on</strong> a diverse range of activities, from the vibrant <strong>Performing Arts showcases</strong> and invigorating <strong>CCA trials</strong> to the bustling <strong>Sports Bazaar</strong>. <strong>Complementing these were</strong> engaging School, House Orientation, and team building activities, all undertaken with <strong>exuberant spirit</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the camp culminated in the Badge Pinning Ceremony, where parents were invited to participate in the induction of their sons into our school. There was great joy all around as parents pinned the school badges onto their sonsâ€™ uniforms. The successful camp was a product of the effort of the Prefects, ACSplorers and House leaders, who put much heart into taking care of their Year 1 juniors!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture21.jpg"></div><p>Paying rapt attention during the Performing Arts Showcase.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture22.jpg"></div><p>Pose for the camera!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture23.jpg"></div><p>Enthusiastic participation in sports activities.</p>
