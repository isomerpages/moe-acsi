<p><strong>A Vibrant Celebration: Chinese New Year Concert 2024</strong>
</p>
<p>The Chinese New Year Concert 2024 dazzled with exciting performances by
the CPAC drummers, Vocal Accord, Philharmonic Orchestra, Dance Venia, and
even our dedicated teachers. My personal highlight was the memorable segment
featuring students in traditional Big Head Doll costumes. Their energy
and enthusiasm were infectious, making it a standout moment. The dedication
and hard work poured into the concert shone through in every performance,
making for a truly special experience.</p>
<p>As the celebration reached its peak, members of the senior administration
distributed mandarin oranges to teachers and ESS staff, wishing everyone
a prosperous new year. Students cheered and laughed as their class photos
graced the screen, accompanied by festive Chinese New Year melodies. Witnessing
this joyful celebration filled our school with warmth and unity, and I
am grateful to have been a part of making it happen.</p>
