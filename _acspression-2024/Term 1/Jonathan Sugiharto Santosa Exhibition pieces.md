<p>Jonathan Sugiharto Santosa</p>
<p><strong>Arsenal</strong> (118 x 84 cm)</p>
<p>Oil on Canvas and Digital Painting</p>
<p><em>This piece acts as the foundation for the entire exhibition, it represent what my mind &nbsp;is grounded on in order to embark on this 4-year journey. It represents my love to explore and to enjoy new things in life. In art, I explored various artistic expressions and experimented with different media. It is evident in this diptych; both parts are visually distinguished from each other due to the use of different media and techniques. It is to emphasise the duality between digital and traditional art forms.</em>

<p><strong>An Alley for The Ephemeral Wanderer</strong> (58 x 84cm)</p>
<p>Digital Painting</p>
<p><em>My life is everything I have; the existence of life itself makes the journey worth experiencing. This piece intends to depict the uncertainty of the future, the infinite alleys I may choose to take in life, and the finite time I have as compared to the infinite nature of after-life. Since Life has an expiration date and time is limited for us; it creates a sense of urgency in us to achieve something in life. We are part of the world. After our death, we will permanently be with the universe.</em>

<p><strong>Friends Along the Way</strong> (102 x 102 cm)</p>
<p>Oil on Canvas</p>
<p><em>We should never care much about external things happening to us and should focus mainly on our actions regarding the external experience. The journey in Singapore is never truly about me alone. It is the positive events and mix of emotions my friends and I have journeyed through the past four years. The struggles, chaos, enjoyment, and connection we experienced together. This painting serves as a reminder of these chapters of our lives.</em>

<p><strong>Home Away from Home</strong> (31 x 61 cm)</p>
<p>Oil on Canvas</p>
<p><em>This is an oil painting of my school and the boarding school. The expressive and unpolished painting style is to convey the complex feelings and stories of my journey over the past 4 years within this home of mine that I hold dearly. ACS(I) is and will always be my home away from home; I framed the painting to show the view I saw the first time I came into and most probably be what I will be seeing when I leave the school - the unchanging home for many others like me, before and far into the future.</em>

<p><strong>Iâ€™ll Break</strong> (84 x 96 cm)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Digital Painting</p>
<p><em>"I'll Break" is a play on the IB acronym, which portrays the challenges and reflections of my IB journey in ACS(I). I'll break has a dual meaning: first, a potential breakdown from academic pressure, impacting mental and physical well-being. On the other hand, it represents the opportunity to break free from the comfort zone, embracing growth and improvement under social pressure and teacher guidance. The pressure mainly stems from the competitiveness of the environment and self-doubt.</em>
