<p><strong>Science Research Challenge: A Learning Journey</strong></p><p>November last year marked the exciting start of Science Research Challenge (SRC) members' marine stewardship journey with FishX by Marine Stewards Singapore. With a mix of curiosity and perhaps a hint of skepticism about the usual "boring, tiring" fishing image, we set off on excursions to Bedok jetty.</p><p>Little did we know, East Coast's rich waters had a surprise in store. Our simple shrimp bait started reeling in fishes every few minutes, from vibrant terapons and damselfish to curious pufferfish! FishX's expert guides patiently shared their insights into fish habits and species-specific catching tips.</p><p>But this wasn't just about catching. The "CPR" (catch, photo, release) framework taught us the delicate balance of collecting ecological data while ensuring the fishes' safe return. By learning the right material choices and release techniques, we understood how responsible research coexists with protecting our precious marine ecosystems.</p><p>These fishing trips were more than just a fun activity; they sparked SRC's passion for becoming advocates for sustainable fishing. We actively participated in FishX's program, spreading awareness about ocean conservation and the importance of appreciating the resources, biodiversity, and adventures that our seas offer.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture12.jpg"></div><p>Briefing prior to the activity</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture13.jpg"></div><p>Small pufferfish caught</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture14.jpg"></div><p>Happy with the catch</p>
