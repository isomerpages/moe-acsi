<p><strong>40 Year 4 boys from our 2023 Integrated Programme embarked on an</strong> Overseas
Values-in-Action (VIA) Service-Learning trip to Baray, Cambodia. <strong>VIA service-learning trip to Baray, Cambodia, from January 15th to 20th.</strong> Mimicking
a CAS project, they expressed their <strong>creativity</strong> by painting
Kreul High School walls, <strong>serving</strong> the community by building
well pavements, and <strong>teaching</strong> English and hygiene to children.</p>
<p><strong>Immersion in the local culture</strong> broadened their perspectives.
Distributing charity packs and interacting with Cambodian youths offered
insights into their lives. An agricultural tour and noodle-making workshop
showcased unique aspects rarely seen in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>Memories etched, hearts touched,</strong> the trip fostered respect
and appreciation for Cambodians and diverse cultures. It was a <strong>profound experience</strong> that
enriched both the students and their Cambodian counterparts.&nbsp;</p>
