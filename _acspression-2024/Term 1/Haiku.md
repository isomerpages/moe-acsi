<p><em>I was greatly inspired by my time in the Edo-Tokyo Architectural Museum, which I visited during my overseas enrichment programme. Exploring the grounds with my classmates was very enjoyable. One of the most exciting parts was definitely stepping into reconstructed buildings from Edo-Period Japan, such as traditional homes, farmhouses, and shops. We had to remove our shoes before entering any exhibits so as to not damage the delicate tatami mats and floors, which was a memory that stayed with me.</em></p><p><strong>Talia Ann Chung</strong></p><p><strong>6.18</strong></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture20.png"></div><p></p>
