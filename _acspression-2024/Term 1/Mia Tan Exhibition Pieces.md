<p><strong>Curio (2023) &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>80 x 101 cm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oil on Canvas</p>
<p>Amidst a life that tends to feel like tedium, small curiosities are significant
to me. Flowers in the sidewalk. sunlight slanting onto concrete. The rarer
ones tend to stun me - encountering a poet my age, and on a typewriter,
tapping out stanzas for any sum of money, I was gratified that something
like that was even possible. Admiration for Benwei’s commitment to living
thoroughly and sharing his art culminated in this portrait. Behind his
head, a painting of the city alludes to thoughts in it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Orpheus I and II (2023)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 101 x 80 cm each</p>
<p>Oil on canvas</p>
<p><em>In contrast to my friend, the human musician, the second Orpheus depicts the urban environment that I live in. James McNeill Whistler’s various Nocturnes inspire</em>  <em>Orpheus II’s translucent finish, while Millais’ glazes inspire Orpheus. Where <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Orpheus</a> I has deep navy grey on pale lilac, Orpheus II inverts the colour scheme for the establishment of a mimetic partnership between both canvases.&nbsp;</em>
