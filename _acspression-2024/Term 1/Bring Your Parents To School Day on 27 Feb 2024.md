<p>On 27 February, we held our annual <em>Bring Your Parents to School</em> Day.
It was a joy to welcome the parents of our Year 1 students and share a
special day with them.</p>
<p>Year 1 parents gained an authentic school experience by joining their
sons for the morning assembly on the artificial turf. The interactive half-day
program allowed them to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enjoy breakfast with their sons at the Student Activity Centre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embark on personalized school tours conducted by their sons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Witness student-led presentations in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meet their sonsâ€™ Pastoral Class Teachers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After bidding farewell to their parents, the boys were captivated by the
engaging Book Buzz Talk presented by the NLB. Their enthusiastic responses
and loud applause at the end were a testament to their enjoyment. <em>Bring Your Parents to School</em>  <em>Day </em>was
a resounding success. It served as a powerful reminder of the positive
impact strong school-family partnerships can have on students' development.</p>
