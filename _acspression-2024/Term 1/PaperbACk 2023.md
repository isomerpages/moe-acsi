<p>The PaperbACk event held in semester 2 was a resounding success.&nbsp;The students enjoyed the enlightening talk by Professor Rajeev Patke, Director, Division of Humanities, Professor of Humanities (Literature), Yale-NUS College. Professor Patke addressed the topic – “Why read ‘modern’ literature at all?” which kept the audience enthralled with his profound insights on modern literature.&nbsp;It was heartening to see so many students in attendance!&nbsp;Enthusiastic literature students from Year 3 and 4 SBGE, Year 4 ACH, Year 5 and 6 Lit and HSP students formed part of the audience.&nbsp;Professor Patke invited students from the audience to read poems by W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound and Marianne Moore and provided interesting and thought-provoking insights into modern poetry. PaperbACk is a Literature Reading Club run by the Department of English Language and Literature, IBDP.</p><p>Students from all levels interacted with Professor Patke after his talk, displaying their keen interest in modern literature.</p><p><em>"I found Prof Patke's lecture very insightful as it reminded me why literature is essential for a reflective interpretation of our complex and progressive world."</em></p><p>(Tan Wei Kang, 6.18, 2023)</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>"Hearing Prof. Patke share so passionately and with so much wisdom about the importance of modern literature despite the skepticism in our society, truly resonated with me, and reignited my belief in the power of literature.
