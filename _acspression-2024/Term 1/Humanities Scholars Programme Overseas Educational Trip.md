<p><strong><u>Overseas Educational Trip to Japan</u></strong></p><p>&nbsp;From 16 to 23 November, the Humanities Scholarsâ€™ Programme (HSP) class embarked on an exciting trip to Tokyo. We had opportunities to immerse ourselves in the rich culture of Japan; visiting the many majestic palaces and lush gardens the city had to offer, and engaged first-hand, with their intricate customs and the Japanese way of life.</p><p>The educational highlights of this trip included visits to museums of history, art and architecture, the International Christian University (ICU), and a dialogue session at the Singapore Embassy. From sightseeing on a cruise to exploring Ghibli's whimsical worlds,&nbsp;we immersed ourselves in the city's diverse offerings,&nbsp;culminating in a magical day at Tokyo Disneyland. This trip has undoubtedly brought our class closer together, and to have this once-in-a-lifetime learning experience is something we are incredibly grateful to the school, and MOE for.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Caitlyn Siriban and Timothy Lagman</p><p>&nbsp;5.18, 2023</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture10.jpg"></div><p>Cruising along Tokyo</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/ACSpression/2024/Picture11.jpg"></div><p>Bonding over bus rides</p>
