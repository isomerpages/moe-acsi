<p>On 17 Nov 2023, the annual Gallery Night in the Art Centre celebrated
the achievements of our Higher Level Visual Arts students Ashley Lim Le
Xuan, Jonathan Sugiharto Santosa, and Mia Tan Chih Ning. The exhibition
showcased more than 24 pieces of their works, mainly oil and digital paintings.
It also symbolized the grand finale of their two-year IB Visual Arts journey
with us.</p>
<p>Additionally, selected artworks by students from Lower Secondary Levels
and Y5 art students were showcased in the exhibition. The media ranged
from 2D drawing, 3D sculptures, to logo design and oil painting.</p>
<p>The vibrant culmination of a three-week artistic journey, Gallery Night
marked the finale of ACspressivo X, which kicked off with the Music Elective
Programme Concert. During the three weeks, many of our students and teachers
and guests visited the exhibition. It was indeed a meaningful event for
the students, and we are looking forward to the next Gallery Night in 2024.</p>
