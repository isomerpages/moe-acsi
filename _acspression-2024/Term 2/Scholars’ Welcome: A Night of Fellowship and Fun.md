<p>The Hospitality and Integration (Hi!) Programme, organised by the ACS(I)
PSG EXCO, warmly welcomed new boarders from many Asian countries at the
2024 Scholars’ Welcome on 30 January from 5:30pm to 8pm, fostering camaraderie
and new friendships over a sumptuous buffet and games. Host parents and
new boarders, some meeting for the first time, gathered for this session
of bonding. There were games played between the boarders and their host
families as they shared a meal together for the first time. The delectable
local-flavoured ice cream traditionally served with wafers was a hit amongst
all. Host families and boarders exchanged handwritten notes to build support
and encouragement within the community. This event has successfully laid
the foundation for a thriving community of students and host families for
the year ahead.</p>
