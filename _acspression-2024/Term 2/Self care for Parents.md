<p>On 27 March, &nbsp;Mr James Satchy, a Family for Life Educator and Head
of TOUCH Parenting presented an insightful talk on self-care for ACS(I)
parents. His engaging presentation, titled "The A.P.R.O. Approach to Parent
Self-Care," reminded us of the crucial role well-being plays in navigating
the joys and challenges of parenthood.</p>
<p>Mr Satchy's acronym, A.P.R.O., provided a valuable framework for managing
stress and triggers. His message resonated deeply, emphasising the importance
of self-care as the foundation for effectively caring for our children.</p>
<p>The evening offered a welcome return to in-person interaction. During
dinner, parents mingled and shared stories with fellow parents and senior
administration, a refreshing change from the online events of recent years.
A lively Q&amp;A session concluded the evening, empowering parents with
Mr Satchy's insights on effective parenting strategies.</p>
