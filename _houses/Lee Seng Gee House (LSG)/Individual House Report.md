Lee Seng Gee House has shown good performance in this yearâ€™s annual Inter-house Swimming, Track and Field, and Cross Country Championships. Throughout these sports events, our members showed good spirit even in the face of tough competition from other Houses. They enthusiastically gave it their all and put up a good fight, eventually earning 3rd place in the Track and Field championship, 7th place in the Swimming Championship, and 6th place in the Cross-country Championship to obtain an overall 7th position.

At the swimming championships, our house attained commendable results, attaining 3rd in the 200 LC relay in the Open Boys category as well as an overall 3rd for the Open Boys category. In the track and field championships, our house put up a strong, attaining 1st, 4th, 7th and 2nd in the groups 1 to 4 categories respectively, as well as 4th for the open girls category. For the cross-country championships, the members of group 1 managed to attain an overall 1st in their category.

Despite not having many school athletes, our House had full sign-ups for all three sporting events. Hence we are proud of our House members for embodying the true spirit of friendly competition and sportsmanship; and who represented our House with pride even with the all odds stacked against them.

All in all, none of these would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our House manager, Mdm Stephanie Ong, the House leaders, the level representatives of the House, and of course the members of the House. The Best is Yet to Be for Lee Seng Gee House!  <br>
