The Wolf is often associated with fierce and powerful warriors. Steadfast, Loyal and Diligent, the Wolf guides us when we are feeling lost and will be our protector as we start our journey on new unexplored paths and help us gain insights, wisdom and confidence.

Wolves embody the values of loyalty, steadfastness and diligence in protecting the welfare of their community. We pledge to promote team spirit and foster strong bonds among the LSG members, overcoming obstacles together as a united pack of warriors. Being a wolf also teaches us to conquer our deepest fears, making ourselves better and thus holding true to the school’s motto of **The Best is Yet to Be.**
