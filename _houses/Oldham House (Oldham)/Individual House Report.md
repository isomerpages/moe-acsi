**Oldham House 2018**

2018 has been a year of immense growth in the Oldham house spirit.

Despite starting the year with our weakest event, the Annual Inter-House Swimming Championships, Oldham came together and managed to achieve a position higher than that of previous years. Many Oldham team members enthusiastically volunteered to participate in the Swimming Championships for the first time, expressing their dedication to the house. It was truly heart-warming to see the Oldham team members across all years cheering each other on. I was touched to see how members of the team quickly jumped into action when one student was unable to participate at the last minute. Oldham members from all levels searched for someone who could step in, ensuring that Oldham could still be represented in the event.

Oldham shone in the Annual Track and Field event, clinching the well deserved 2nd position. Oldham performed especially well in our relay events, demonstrating the strong team spirit and bond that is unique to Oldham members. At the Annual Cross-Country Championships, Oldham’s competitive runners put up a good fight. Members ran with resilience and determination, performing exceptionally well in the Group 3 and Open Girls categories.

I am honoured to have had the privilege of serving as House Captain over the past year. The selfless actions of the team that constantly prioritised House have been inspiring. This year would not have been possible without the exceptional Oldham committee, especially our House manager, Madam Tan Hui Ming, who constantly encouraged the committee and members. The Oldham Vice House Captains have kept the Oldham spirit high and contributed their all to Oldham. I am especially proud of our level representatives who have taken a big step up this year, taking on numerous responsibilities and doing their best to bring Oldham to victory. I would also like to extend my appreciation to Madam Diane Choo and Mister Peter Dumotier who put their faith in us in the beginning and have guided us throughout the year.

To God be the Glory, The Best Is Yet to Be.
