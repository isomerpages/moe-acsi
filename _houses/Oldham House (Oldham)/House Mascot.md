Eagles are associated with courage and the desire to stretch one’s limits. As eagles, we do not accept the status quo, but aim to achieve greater heights to fulfil our potential. We look at things from a new, higher perspective. Eagles teach us to be patient with the present; know that the future holds unseen possibilities because **The Best is Yet to Be**. For those of us who may have gone through a hard time, an eagle not only signals a new beginning, but provides us with the stamina and resilience to endure the difficulties. If an eagle has appeared, it bestows freedom and courage to look ahead.

The eagle bestows a symbol of honesty and integrity. The members of Oldham House will summon the eagle when they embark on a challenge, a massive life change or a creative endeavor.
