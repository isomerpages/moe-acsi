Our TCT girls did us proud by clinching first place for the Open Girls category at the Annual Swimming Championships. Ong Jung Yi (5.16 Ephesians) also did us proud, by achieving first place in 100m and 200m free, 50m fly, and 200 individual medley.

At the Annual Track and Field Championships, in the Open Boys category, Choo Jun-Henn Shaun (6.08 Galatia) finished first in the 100m sprint. Our Group 2 and Open Boys put up a great showing coming in 3rd and 2nd placing respectively.

This year’s Annual Cross Country event was exceptionally memorable as we saw TCT producing stellar results when we achieved a highly respectable overall joint 2nd place amongst the eight houses. In the Group 2 category, Gabriel Tan Eng Kian (2.02 Simeon) clinched 1st place and Chua E-Chao Colby (2.08 Mannaseh) came in 3rd. It was truly a victorious moment for TCT.

2018 has been a very fulfilling year for TCT as we made an exceptional improvement from previous years, coming in 3rd place overall with the unwavering support of our members. We are indeed very thankful to all our members, our graduating House Captain and Vice-Captain and House Manager for their dedication and support.

We will continue to strive for excellence in the years ahead.
