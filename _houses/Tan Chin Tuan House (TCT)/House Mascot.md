The Lion, leader of the animal kingdom, is synonymous with strength and courage. Proverbs 28:1 states that “the wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion”. It is this steadfastness of character which distinguishes them from other animals; one that shows courage in the face of adversity and armed with an unwavering determination to succeed against all odds.

Lions, unlike other members of the feline family and contrary to the human construct of them, survive through co-operation. They gather in prides and work together for the survival of their family unit, knowing the power of unity in strength. They bear the burden for one another and care for one another when others are injured; a seeming empathy that transcends human language. Members of the TCT House should harness these traits of teamwork, steadfastness and let it shine through in all endeavors that they may embark on for **the Best is Yet to Be**.
