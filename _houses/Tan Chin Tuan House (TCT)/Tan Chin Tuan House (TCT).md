The relationship between the Tan family and ACS can be traced back to Mr Tan Cheng Siong (the father of Tan Chin Tuan) who supported Rev Nagle’s aborted plan to establish Anglo-Chinese College. Educated in ACS, Tan Sri Tan Chin Tuan is most synonymous with the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC) for his role in building it into one of the world’s top banks. His success in the business world is paralleled by his contribution to public service where he was involved in many aspects of Singapore’s post-war rehabilitation and was from 1951-55 the Deputy President of the Singapore Executive Council. A noted philanthropist, he was the President of the ACSOBA (1938 – 41) and continues to be a generous benefactor to the ACS schools. His generosity to his alma mater, Anglo-Chinese School, is commemorated in numerous building projects and scholarships awarded to outstanding students at both ACS (Independent) and Anglo-Chinese Junior College and named after ACS pioneers. In return for his staunch support for ACS, he is said to have hoped that the School produce good students with moral fibre.
