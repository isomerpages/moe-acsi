A bull is always a figure of strength and steadfastness, always hardworking allowing everyone to reap the best of rewards, this creature is also symbolic of confidence. As a team member of a cattle, it ensures that everyone is well and healthy, and work gets done in excellence. A bull exhibits traits of determination, passion and endurance amidst the challenges.

We pledge to be empowered with conviction to overcome obstacles as a House, a community and family that stays together through thick and thin. One may never be disappointed in its work, just as how members of the CKS may rely on the conviction of their mascot, to pull them through the thick and thin. With diligence and resilience, this creature is bound to impress anyone who doubts.
