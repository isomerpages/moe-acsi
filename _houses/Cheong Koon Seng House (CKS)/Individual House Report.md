2018 was indeed a remarkable year for CKS. We are extremely proud of all our house members and student athletes who demonstrated extraordinary sportsmanship and dedication to their house on the playing field.

These efforts certainly paid off during the 81st Annual Swimming Championships, where the combined grit and determination of our secondary and IB swimmers allowed us to attain the overall 3rd placing, granting us a favourable start to the year.

At the 104th Annual Track and Field Championships, our members did the house proud by participating wholeheartedly across a multitude of events, braving the scorching heat on the track to do their best in an admirable display of house spirit. This helped us secure the overall 6th placing in the meet.

We ended the year on a celebratory note with the 54th Annual Cross Country Championships, as we attained the overall 5th placing. Our Open Boys team did us especially proud, coming in as First Runner-up amidst the stiff competition from other houses. Rajesh Muthu from class 5.04 and Hong Yan Jie from class 5.14 also attained the coveted 1st and 2nd Runner-up individual positions in the Open Boys category.

We are very grateful for our House Manager, Mdm Mohana, for her continual efforts to push us to greater heights, as well as each and every one of our house members who participated actively and gave it their all during the events. Perhaps something more rewarding to witness, apart from the placings and prizes, was the remarkable growth in house spirit amongst our members, which was key towards unlocking the true potential of our house.

CKS has, and always will, strive for continued excellence in everything we do, and we hope that this will continue to push us to even greater heights in the years to come, for the best is truly yet to be.
