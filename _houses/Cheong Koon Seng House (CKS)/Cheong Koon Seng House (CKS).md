As one of the earliest ACSians, Mr Cheong Koon Seng joined the school in 1891. A successful businessman and a well-known public figure as the Municipal Councillor, he was for many years the President of ACSOBA. In the 1934 ACS Magazine, Mr Cheong was memorialized as “_a genial friend, a sound businessman and a loyal old boy of the school to which he had rendered valuable and ungrudging help_.” Working closely with the Methodist Mission, he helped to acquire the land at Barker Road where the ACS (Barker Road) complex now stands.
