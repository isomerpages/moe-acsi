Tigers are fast, fierce competitors who never fail to rise up to challenges, fighting with steadfastness until the battle is won. Tigers know that even when a battle is won, we can always achieve greater heights becauseÂ **The Best is Yet to Be**. Known as kings of the jungle, tigers are known for their majestic stripes and their thunderous roars. These stripes allow them to blend perfectly into their surroundings, becoming one with others and yet standing out in the limelight.

Tigers are known to be good leaders. We can usually be found on the front lines, walking the talk and most importantly empowering others to do the same with humility and empathy.
