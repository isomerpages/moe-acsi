TKK House Report 2018

Galatians 6:9 reads “Let us not be weary in doing good, for at a proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.” Ever since the Tan Kah Kee house was established, we  strived for excellence. The quote tells us that if we are steadfast in our actions and persevere till the end, we will reap the rewards for our hard work. Currently our house has been reaping the sweet rewards of our labour. Tan Kah Kee House has been the pinnacle for excellence in sports and house spirit throughout the years.

In the years 2015 and 2016, TKK clinched the overall champions trophy.We persevere through every competition and compete with true grit and a “never-say-die” attitude. This year we achieved stellar results in the Annual Swimming championships, clinching an overall second place. We are truly thankful that TKK has been blessed with extremely athletic and passionate individuals who have contributed much to the house. However, this success could not have been possible without the care and dedication of our House Manager, Mdm Nilanjana Bose, and our respective level representatives.

TKK wishes all our supporters and athletes all the best as we seek to improve on this past season. We look forward to another successful and memorable year ahead.

To God be the Glory, The Best is truly Yet to Be
