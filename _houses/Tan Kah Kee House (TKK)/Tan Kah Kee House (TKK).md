A prolific Patron of education, Mr Tan Kah Kee is synonymous with leadership, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and social reform. Mr Tan was also a member of the Anglo-Chinese College Council formed by Rev Nagle and had himself pledged S$100,000 to the proposed Anglo Chinese School College in 1919. However, when the proposal was turned down by the Government, Tan Kah Kee agreed to channel the $30,000 he had given to the ACS fund for physics and chemistry. This helped to complete the Secondary School at Cairnhill in 1928.
