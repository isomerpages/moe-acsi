A prominent Old Boy, Dr Shaw Vee Meng is the Chairman of the Shaw Foundation which was set up in 1957. The Shaw Foundation has given generously to various fields of education, welfare, medicine and heritage. In 1970, Shaw Foundation financed the new Olympic-sized pool, Shaw Pool, at the ACS at Barker Road, making it the first school in Singapore to own such a sporting facility. The Shaw Foundation has also funded various other school projects such as the building of one block of classrooms, named Shaw Block in the old Barker Road Campus and the Shaw Library at ACS (Independent). To this day, the Shaw Foundation continues to make generous donations to the ACS family of Schools.
