Sharks have been around our planet for million years and are extremely efficient creatures. They have survived and remained in their original form, proving the effectiveness of their behaviour and anatomy.

In the face of challenges, SVM will show the true spirit of courage and steadfastness by taking on the fearless spirit of the shark. With over 300 species of sharks, these creatures come in various sizes, ranging from several inches to 60 feet. Despite their varying sizes, sharks collectively play a vital role in their community in balancing the ecosystem. They are much needed in the ocean and hold the very integrity of the ocean ecosystem together.

In the same way, coming from diverse backgrounds, we, the members of SVM will be the ones to form the fabric of the ACS community, the ones who uphold the ACsian spirit!
