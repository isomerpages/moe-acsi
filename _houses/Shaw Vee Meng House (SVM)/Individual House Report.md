---
2018 has been an incredibly fulfilling and fruitful year for Shaw Vee Meng (SVM) House. Through hard work and tenacity, our athletes have embodied the fiery spirit of competitiveness, bringing both honor and glory to our House.

We began the sporting year with the Annual Swimming Championships. Facing tough competition, Joshua Yeo Wee Chee (Class 3.13 Haggai) put in an incredible shift in the pool, emerging as the Group 3 individual champion, thus contributing greatly to the success of the Group 3 swimmers who victoriously emerged as the Level Champions. Through the efforts of our swimmers, SVM was able to secure a respectable 5th place finish overall.

For the Annual Track and Field Championships followed, our Group 3 athletes did the House proud once again. Matthew Yong Hsien Wei (Class 3.16 Habakkuk) emerged as the overall Group 3 individual champion. Our Open Boys and Open Girls relay team were able to secure Gold medal finishes in their respective 4 X 100m relays, with Junior Vice-Captain Shanya Shanmugam (Class 5.05 Deuteronomy) crossing the finishing line in first-place in the Girls 200m race.

Determined to finish strong as the 2018 Inter-House sport calendar drew to a close, the members of SVM marched boldly into the Annual Cross-Country Championships, demonstrating the strong qualities of our mascot, the shark. Indeed, we ended well and with a bang, clinching a stellar 3rd place finish across all levels.

Looking back, 2018 has been an extremely rewarding year for SVM. The vigor and enthusiasm shown by our house members were reflected by our improvement in overall House standings from 7th to 2nd place. We would like to thank Mr. Yeo Wee Kong, our House manager, for his hard work this Inter-House season and God for without whom none of this would have been possible. SVM will continuing striving for greatness for The Best is truly Yet To Be.
