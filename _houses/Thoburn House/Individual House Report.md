As members of Thoburn House competed in the annual roster of events, the inter-house Swimming, Track and Field, and cross country championships, they strived to put up their best performance and certainty did not disappoint. Coming in at a respectable 4th place in the annual Swimming and 7th in cross country championships allowing them to place 5th in the overall standings.

At the annual Swimming championships, our year 3 and 4 boys put up an especially excellent show of talent as they swam to a bronze medal in the group 4 200m medley relay and a silver in the groups 3 and 4 200m freestyle relays. Our boys also put on an exceptional showing at the Track and Field championships coming in in 3rd place in the open boys 4x400m relay and 1st in the group 2 4x100m relay. Thoburn members of the open category also did outstandingly well at this year’s annual cross country event coming in 2nd for the open girls category and 1st in the open boys category for the second year running. The year 1 boys too finished on top of the podium allowing Thoburn to rank 4th overall, a great and promising improving over their position in 2017.

However, it should also be said that all these accomplishments would not have been made possible if not for the support of our House manager Cao Hui Zhong, level representatives and House leaders along with the enthusiastic support of all House members as they cheered on their fellow House mates.

To God be the glory, the best is yet to be!
