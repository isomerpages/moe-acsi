Stags are often seen as very vigilant and graceful animals who are able to adapt quickly to changes in their habitat. They are agile creatures who lead their herd, always keeping a watchful eye on every member. Despite their gentle demeanour, stags also exert power through their keen observation and sensitivity to others.

Hence, as stags, when we are faced with challenges and setbacks, we will not abandon each other. Instead, we will overcome obstacles with our high sense of Empathy and Loyalty. Similarly, as one house, we will listen to every opinion voiced, making sure that everyone has a part to play in our family. Together as one herd, we can strive to achieve greater things, forÂ **The Best is Yet to Be.**
