Thoburn House was named after Bishop Dr James Thoburn. He was responsible for initiating and accompanying the pioneer mission to Singapore. He and Bishop Oldham were responsible for the setting up of the Methodist Church as a Mission in Singapore in 1885. Bishop Dr Thoburn’s vision, with Bishop Oldham’s active mission, made possible the birth of ACS. Had it not been for him, there might not have been an ACS. It was his personal initiative as an important leader in the Methodist Conference in India that resulted in the planting of the first Methodist Church in Singapore in 1885.
