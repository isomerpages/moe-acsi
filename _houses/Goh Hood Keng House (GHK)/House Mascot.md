Throughout history, owls have been associated with wisdom, diligence and steadfastness. In times of uncertainty or chaos, the keen-sighted owls possess the innate ability to stay focused on the ultimate goal, making solid decisions based on an astute sense of judgement even through the cloak of night.

The guardian of the forest, this ever-vigilant creature is always in tune with its surroundings, aware of every footfall and every birdcall.

As visionary members of the GHK house, we should remember that **the Best is Yet to Be**, for the future holds both unfathomed challenges waiting to be conquered as well as infinite possibilities ready to be seized.
