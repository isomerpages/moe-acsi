2018 has proven to be yet another year of outstanding performances from Goh Hood Keng House. Our GHK athletes fought hard, valiantly and resiliently for all three of our school’s sports events. The numerous achievements throughout the year were made possible with the concerted effort and contribution by our members.

We started the year strong, clinching the overall championship title in the 80th Annual Inter-House Swimming Championships. The grit and perseverance displayed by our younger athletes paid off as our House attained the first position in the Group 1 and 2 categories.

The results obtained in the Annual Track and Field Championships were also testament to the power of unity and House pride. GHK maintained its winning streak and came in first place. Our athletes competed tirelessly at each event. Overall, GHK managed to emerge as champions in 4 out of 6 categories.

We concluded the sporting year with a stellar performance in the Annual Cross Country Championships, emerging as champions once again.

It has undoubtedly been an amazing and eventful year for GHK – we scored our first hat trick this year, winning all three events, thereby securing the Overall House Championship for 2018. This grand slam would not have been possible without our members, leaders and House manager. GHK promises to perform to the best of our ability and to give our all in our pursuit of excellence.

To God be the glory, the best is yet to be!
