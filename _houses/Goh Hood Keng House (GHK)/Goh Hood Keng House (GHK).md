Rev Goh Hood Keng was enrolled in ACS “_as a lad barely six years of age_”. After graduation, he taught for 20 years in ACS and distinguished himself as one of the most esteemed teachers of the school. His students included Yap Pheng Geck, Thio Chan Bee and Lee Choon Eng among many other distinguished ACSians. At the same time, he became a local preacher and later a full minister of the Church. He was the first Singaporean ordained Methodist Minister. As a minister of the Methodist Church, he pastured the Straits Chinese Methodist Church (Kampong Kapor Methodist Church) for nearly 40 years until he retired in 1952. As a preacher, Bishop Doraisamy considered him a “legend before his time”.
