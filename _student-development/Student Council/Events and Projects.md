Student Councillors are Year 5 and 6 students united by a common passion: to give back to the school family and embody the spirit of servant leadership. The Student Council is first and foremost a family which models the empathetic, creative and passionate community we want to create in school. Bringing together leaders from all walks of life, the Student Council serves as a platform for students to hone their leadership skills, apply their unique talents meaningfully, and propose new initiatives to improve the schooling experience for all. Undergirding Councillors’ leadership is the Leadership Challenge Model developed by James Kouzes and Barry Z. Posner, which provides substantial grounds for authentic and purpose-driven leadership.

Besides planning events and supporting the school in its various operations, the Student Council also plans ad-hoc initiatives to meet the needs of the school or cohort, and works closely with the teachers and Senior Administration. Some examples of events planned are the Year 5 Orientation, Teachers’ Day Celebrations and ACSemble, an annual concert showcasing student talent. Initiatives and events planned have the goal of building school spirit and improving student welfare. Ultimately, we hope to be leaders who will in turn empower those around them, being positive influences in our communities.
