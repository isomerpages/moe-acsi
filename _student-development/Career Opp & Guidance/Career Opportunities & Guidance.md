The Career Opportunities and Guidance (COG) Unit aims to facilitate greater awareness about self and opportunities to enable students to make well-informed decisions regarding their future higher education and career goals. In addition, the Unit seeks to involve parents, to keep them up-to-date with the higher education and employment landscape, as we recognise parents play a vital role in guiding their children’s transition towards higher education.It delivers a comprehensive range of services, including but not limited to:

*   individual consultation sessions (education and career counselling, guidance on university applications, resume review, review on application essays)
*   organising opportunities for students and parents to engage with representatives from universities, government agencies, industry professionals and alumni
*   administrating university applications
