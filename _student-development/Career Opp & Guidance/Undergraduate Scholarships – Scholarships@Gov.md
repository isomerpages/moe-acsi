The Public Service Commission (PSC) has launched a new website known as Scholarships@Gov ([https://www.scholarships.gov.sg/](https://www.scholarships.gov.sg/)). This website brings together all the information on public sector scholarships and public service careers on a single platform. It is hoped that this will serve anyone interested in the public sector scholarships, better in accessing information about public sector scholarships and careers.
