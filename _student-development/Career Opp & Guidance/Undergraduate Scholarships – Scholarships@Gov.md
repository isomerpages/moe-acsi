The Public Service Commission (PSC) has launched a new website known as Scholarships@Gov ([https://www.scholarships.gov.sg/](https://www.scholarships.gov.sg/)). This website brings together all the information on public sector scholarships and public service careers on a single platform. It is hoped that this will serve anyone interested in the public sector scholarships, better in accessing information about public sector scholarships and careers.

PSC has recently launched two new specialised scholarship programmes. To access further information, please click below:
