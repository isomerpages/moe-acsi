<p><strong>Samuel Lum</strong>
</p>
<p>Samuel (BSc in Psychology) believes in the role of counselling in helping
individuals attain their aspirations in life. He ensures his best by continually
learning as much as he can about its’ practice. To that end, he is currently
undergoing training at the Executive Counselling &amp; Training Academy
for the Masters in Counselling awarded by the Swinburne University of Technology,
Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>Through counselling, he hopes to guide others towards becoming the person
they want to be despite life’s obstacles. He holds firm the belief that
everyone needs an empathic listening ear from time to time and there is
no need to go through challenges alone.</p>
