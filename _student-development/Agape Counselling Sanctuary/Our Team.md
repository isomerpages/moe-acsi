**Samuel Lum**

Samuel (BSc in Psychology) believes in the role of counselling in helping individuals attain their aspirations in life. He ensures his best by continually learning as much as he can about its’ practice. To that end, he is currently undergoing training at the Executive Counselling &amp; Training Academy for the Masters in Counselling awarded by the Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.

Through counselling, he hopes to guide others towards becoming the person they want to be despite life’s obstacles. He holds firm the belief that everyone needs an empathic listening ear from time to time and there is no need to go through challenges alone.
