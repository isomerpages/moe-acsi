ACS Hope is a project started by class 3.10 of 2010 of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). The aim of this project is to raise awareness of emotional health. In recent years, there has been a rise in instances of teenage depression. Teenage depression can lead to various problems arising in a teenager’s life, including acts as severe as self-hurt or even suicide. Due to our desire to help teenagers in need, we have compiled information from various websites that will serve as resource teenagers can turn to when they have problems.

We would like to thank the ACS (Independent) Counseling Department as well as Ms Suppiah for their invaluable guidance, and also the Senior Administration for their unwavering support and kindness. Last but not least, we would like to thank God, without whom none of these would be possible.   **Readings:**
