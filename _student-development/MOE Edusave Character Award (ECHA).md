<h3>EDUSAVE CHARACTER AWARD (ECHA) 2025 &amp; INTEGRITY AWARD 2025</h3>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</u>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) was introduced by the Ministry of Education
in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary
character and outstanding personal qualities through their behavior and
actions. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger
Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged
and applauded. The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing
students of character and values, who are active contributors and concerned
citizens.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Objectives and Guiding Principles </u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objectives of the ECHA are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>To send a clear and strong signal of the importance that MOE places on
character and values, on par with achievements in the academic domain;
and&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To recognise outstanding students in each school who are exemplary in
character, and who can be role models to inspire others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<u>Quota of Awards</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ECHA maximum quota will be capped at 2% of the total enrolment of

of ECHA, and will comprise the nomination, selection and endorsement stages.&nbsp;</p>
