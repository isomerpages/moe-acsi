<p><strong>Values in Action/ CAS (Service)</strong>
</p>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) and CAS (Service) are a key student development
experience that aim to nurture socially responsible citizens who contribute
meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of
values, knowledge, and skills. VIA and CAS (Service) are designed to engender
student ownership and initiative. As part of VIA and CAS (Service), students
reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and
how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.</p>
