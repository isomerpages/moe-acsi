Holistic education provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning and the development of values and life skills in each child.

The school’s two-CCA policy aims to help students achieve a holistic education.  It enables students to discover their strengths, interests and talents and equip them to handle challenges they may face later in life.

Every Year 1- 4 ACSian is expected to participate in two CCAs – one Uniformed Group (UG) and the other, either a Sport, a Performing Art or a Club / Society.
