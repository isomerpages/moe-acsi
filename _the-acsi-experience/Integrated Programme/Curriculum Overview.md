**Curriculum Overview**

The ACS (Independent) Integrated Programme offers a wide array of subject combinations with interdisciplinary approaches similar to that of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) which IP students take in their fifth and sixth years.

The overall programme consists of subjects taken from six discipline groups (Studies in Language and Literature, Language Acquisition, Individuals & Societies, Sciences, Mathematics and the Arts).

At Years 3 & 4, students will offer 8 subjects: 5 compulsory and 3 option subjects.

**<u>Compulsory subjects</u>**

**Mother Tongue Language**

**International Studies** 

**Core Mathematics**

**1 Science subject**

And three other subjects from the following areas:

**1) Humanities**

*   History
*   Geography

**2) Sciences**

*   Physics

Advanced Mathematics

In addition to the curriculum subjects, students will be engaged in the elementary Theory of Knowledge (eTOK) course, an Individualised Study Option (ISO) and the Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experience.  These have been specially designed to provide coherence with the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) where the Theory of Knowledge (TOK) course, the Extended Essay (EE) and CAS form the core of the IB curriculum model.
