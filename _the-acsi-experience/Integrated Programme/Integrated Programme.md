The ACS (Independent) Integrated Programme (IP) is a six-year programme and IP students are not required to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level Examination, except for Mother Tongue.

Students may be admitted into the IP at Year 1 or Year 3 and proceed to do the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) in their fifth and sixth years.

ACS(I)’s IP students do not take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level Examination.

ACS(I)’s IP Students are expected to fulfil their commitment to the school for the full duration, and transfers to other schools are strongly discouraged. In particular, transfers to other IP schools are not allowed, unless under exceptional circumstances.
