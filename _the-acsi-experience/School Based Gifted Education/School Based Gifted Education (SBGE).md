ACS (Independent) has been offering the gifted education programme since 1988 when it became the third secondary GEP centre.

The School Based Gifted Programme (SBGE) for Years 1 – 4 allows for differentiation and enrichment of the curriculum. Class lessons are characterised by enrichment options and offer greater breadth and depth in terms of content coverage. Students are encouraged to explore more advanced topics across different disciplines.

ACS (Independent)’s SBGE is embedded within the Integrated Programme and the SBGE students are placed in classes with students who have similar academic abilities.
