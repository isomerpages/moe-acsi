**<u>Well-being Education @ ACS (Independent)</u>**

On 1 March 1886, Reverend William Fitzjames Oldham founded Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) with the purpose of nurturing students to be of service “for God and humanity[\[1\]](https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/the-acs-independent-experience/pastoral-care-career-guidance-pccg/well-being-education/#_ftn1).”

Bishop Oldham’s vision was for ACS to not only provide good academic education, but that the school should also strive to educate students with good morals and habits consistent with Christian values.

In line with Bishop Oldham’s vision of holistic development, ACS (Independent) piloted the Pastoral Care and Career Guidance (PCCG) programme in 1988, with the objectives to inculcate moral values, build character, develop leadership traits, explore various education / career pathways and equip students with the knowledge and skills related to well-being.

The World Health Organization defines well-being as the presence of a state in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her own community (WHO, 2001).

Research has shown that a focus on well-being leads to improvement in:

*   Student and teacher well-being
*   Academic engagement and participation
*   Retention rates
*   Social and emotional skills
*   Pro-social behavior
*   Academic results

(Durlak et al., 2011; Gray & Hackling, 2009; Noble & McGrath, 2012; Suldo et al., 2010; Bird & Markle, 2012).

Well-being Education (WE) is a whole-school approach with a clear direction in mind –  
To place **_Well-being_** at the **_Heart of Education_**. 

It focuses on building knowledge and skills that help students to strengthen their relationships, develop positive emotions, increase personal resilience and foster a healthy lifestyle. 

Through WE, ACS (Independent) aims to provide its students with an enhanced capacity to learn effectively and offer them a strong foundation on which they can build a flourishing life.

**<u>ACS (Independent) Well-being Education Model</u>**

In order to embed WE in the school community, a conceptual and applied model was developed as a roadmap for everyone to understand how well-being can be conscientiously and deliberately nurtured within the school family.  <u>Figure 1</u> shows the **ACS (Independent) WE Model** which consists of four domains.
