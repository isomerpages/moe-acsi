**The Nature of the PCCG Programme**

The ACS (Independent) Pastoral Care and Career Guidance Programme (PCCG) reinforces the need for affective education and provides the essential balance for the school’s academic programmes.

Our PCCG programme plays an important part in the school’s overall mission in inculcating moral values in the students. The activities organised aim at character building, improving communication skills and developing leadership traits in students.

Our PCCG curriculum is aligned with that of our school’s core purpose, mission, vision, values, desired ACSian outcomes as well as MOE’s prescribed lessons from their Character and Citizenship Education (CCE 2021) curriculum.

It encompasses formal school–based lessons in CCE, Sexuality Education, Cyber Wellness, Education and Career Guidance, Well-being Education and our Values-In-Action activities.

**Aims**

The PCCG programme aims to:

*   fulfil the goals of CCE 2021 which is to develop in our students (i) good character, (ii) resilience and social well-being, (iii) active citizenship and (iv) future readiness.
*   promote human flourishing through the cultivation of well-being knowledge and skills in the ACS(I) family.
