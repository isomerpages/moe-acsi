<p style="text-align: justify;">ACS (Independent) is a Methodist institution with a strong foundation in Christian values and principles and offers a number of programmes, catering to the many interests and talents of our students.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These include the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) Programme leading to the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations and the six-year Integrated Programme leading to the IB Diploma. No matter which programme, students go through an enriching and fulfilling curriculum which helps them be skilled and self-motivated in their quest for knowledge and develop qualities that will enable them to navigate in an increasingly demanding and complex world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our wide range of co-curricular activities enables students to develop their talent, leadership skills, and pursue their passions. Beyond the classroom, ACSians participate in a myriad of activities ranging from contributing services to welfare homes/organisations, charity fundraising activities, and environmental conservation efforts.</p>
