ACS (Independent) is a Methodist institution with a strong foundation in Christian values and principles and offers a number of programmes, catering to the many interests and talents of our students.

These include the Express Programme leading to the GCE ‘O’ levels certificate and the six year Integrated Programme leading to the IB Diploma. No matter which programme, students go through an enriching and fulfilling curriculum which helps them be skilled and self-motivated in their quest for knowledge and develop qualities that will enable them to navigate in an increasingly demanding and complex world.
