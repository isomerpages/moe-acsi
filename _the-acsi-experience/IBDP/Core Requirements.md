<p><strong>DP Core Requirements</strong>
</p>
<p>The DP core is made up of three required components comprising theory
of knowledge (TOK), creativity, activity, service (CAS) and the Extended
Essay (EE). Through the DP core, students reflect on the nature of knowledge,
complete independent research and undertake a project that often involves
community service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TOK, unique to the IB programme, is an interdisciplinary course intended
to stimulate critical reflection on knowledge and experience gained inside
and outside the classroom. The course challenges students to question the
bases of knowledge, to be aware of subjective and ideological biases and
to develop the ability to analyse evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studied throughout the Diploma Programme, CAS involves students in a range
of activities alongside their academic studies. It is not formally assessed.
However, students reflect on their CAS experiences as part of the DP and
provide evidence of achieving learning outcomes. CAS emphasises the importance
of life outside the world of scholarship, providing an essential &nbsp;counterbalance
to academic pursuits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EE is an independent, self-directed piece of research, culminating
with a 4,000-word paper. It provides students with the opportunity to investigate
a topic of personal interest which relates to one of the studentâ€™s six
DP subjects. The EE exposes students to research skills and develops their
capacity to analyse, synthesis and evaluate knowledge. Students are supported
throughout the process of researching and writing the extended essay, with
advice and guidance from a supervisor who is usually a teacher at the school.&nbsp;
