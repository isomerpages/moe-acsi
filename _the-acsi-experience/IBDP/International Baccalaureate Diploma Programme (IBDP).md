<p><strong>What is the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established in 1968, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme
was the first programme offered by IB and is taught to students aged 16
– 19.&nbsp; The Diploma Programme was established to provide students with
a balanced education, facilitate geographic and cultural mobility and to
promote international understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IB Diploma Programme is an academically challenging and balanced programme
of education, with final examinations, that prepares students for success
at university and in life beyond. &nbsp;It has been designed to address
the intellectual, social, emotional and physical well-being of students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IB Diploma Programme has gained recognition and respect from the world’s
leading universities. &nbsp;Research suggests that the Diploma Programme
is a strong pathway to university and evidence suggests that higher rates
of DP students go on to university and higher education study than non-IB
students. &nbsp;It focuses on rigorous academic study within a broad and
balanced curriculum which can prepare students well for employment. &nbsp;Students
in the Diploma Programme also have the opportunity to apply their knowledge
and skills to community service, gaining valuable experience outside the
academic world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) was authorised as an IB World School
in 2005 and was the first national school in Singapore to offer the IB
Diploma Programme.&nbsp; The first cohort of IB Diploma students graduated
in 2007.&nbsp; Since then, 17 cohorts of Diploma Programme students have
graduated from the school, consistently achieving excellent results and
maintaining high standards of academic performance.</p>
