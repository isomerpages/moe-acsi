The IB Diploma Programme has proved to be a compelling pre-university course of study not only because it guarantees breadth of study, but it also provides opportunities for students to develop their independent research skills through an extended essay; to foster an understanding of the epistemological links across the different subject domains through its Theory of Knowledge course and to gain formal recognition of achievement in co-curricular activities through its Creativity, Activity, Service requirement.Â 

The IB Curriculum structure is represented by a hexagon model with six academic subjects surrounding a core.
