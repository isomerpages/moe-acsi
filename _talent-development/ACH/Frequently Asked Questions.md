<p><strong>1. What are the aims of the ACH programme and why is there a need to differentiate from the existing programme?</strong></p>
<p>The school is constantly making adjustments and updating its talent development plans to cater to our students’ needs as well as to prepare them to thrive in the rapidly changing 21st&nbsp;century world where attributes of critical thinking, reflection, communication, cross-cultural skills and global awareness are key.</p>
<p>The ACH programme aims to foster a learning environment that deepens an understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, challenges assumptions and develops their appreciation of the complexities and intricacies of humanity.</p>
<p>While all these aims are currently found in our existing programmes, the ACH aims to provide students who are ready to be challenged with opportunities such as mentoring, service-learning and enriched curricula in Language Arts and the Humanities.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How will it be different from the rest of the IP classes?</strong></h4>
<p>The learning experience of the ACH students will be largely the same as the rest of the IP classes, with the enhancement of the learning opportunities mentioned. ACH students will also be encouraged to participate more fully in the existing programmes organised by MOE, e.g. Creative Arts Programme, Literature Seminar, Humanities and Social Sciences Research Programme, Model United Nations @ AC.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Are these MOE programmes exclusive to the ACH students, i.e., a student needs to be in ACH before he will be considered for these programmes?</strong></h4>
<p>No. These programmes are available to all students who qualify, regardless of whether they are part of ACH or not. These programmes are conducted outside of the main curriculum, but because of the focus of ACH, there will be better integration of knowledge, skills and aptitude development applied in these programmes and in the ACH classroom.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>What will be the class size?</strong></p>
<p>In general, the IP class size range from 28 – 35 students. ACH will be housed in an intact class.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>What will be the subject combination for the students of ACH?</strong></p>
<p>The students of ACH will be offered a well-balanced subject combination that feature two sciences, two mathematics and two humanities subjects.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Can an ACH student offer a triple-science subject combination?</strong></p>
<p>No. The demands of an academic load of three sciences and two humanities subjects are overwhelming. The number of weekly lessons required for such a combination exceeds what the school timetable can support.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Can an ACH student switch back to the science stream when he goes to IB?</strong></p>
<p>The distinction of a Science stream and an Arts stream is an outdated one.</p>
<p>At ACS (Independent), all Year 5 and Year 6 students offer at least a science subject in the IBDP, and the majority of them offer two science subjects, with those who are more inclined towards the sciences offering them at the Higher Level.</p>
<p>ACH students, having gone through the same rigorous science curricula as the rest of the IP students in their cohort will be well-poised to offer science subjects at the IB level, subject to the individual subject pre-requisites.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Will the students of ACH sit for different examination papers?</strong></p>
<p>No. ACH students will sit for the same set of examination papers as the rest of the IP students.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Will there be differentiation in any of the assessment tasks?</strong></p>
<p>Formative assessment is a hallmark of a good curriculum. Because of the differentiated curricular experience of the ACH, students will be challenged in a corresponding manner in the areas of coursework and oral assessment. The intention behind the differentiated assessment tasks is to better capture and recognize the unique learning outcomes of the ACH students.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> <strong>What are the differences between the different programmes that are on offer for high-ability students: SBGE, ACS, ACH, MEP and RSP? Can a student be in more than one programme?</strong></p>
<p>The school is committed to nurturing all our students and bringing them to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>The School-based Gifted Education (SBGE) programme is a continuation from the primary school’s Gifted Education Programme, and it focuses on the holistic development of high-ability students in all academic areas.</p>
<p>With the understanding that students’ interests and abilities may vary and be unevenly spread across the subjects, the Accelerated Class of Science (ACS) and the Accelerated Class of Humanities (ACH) are programmes that are customized to develop students in the specific academic domains that they are strong in and passion about. The ACH and the ACS programmes are considered as part of the SBGE.</p>
<p>An ACH student cannot be in the ACS. This is because the ACS programme requires a student to offer a triple science subject combination (refer to answer for Qn 6).</p>
<p>Similarly, due to the demands of the MEP, MEP students cannot be in the ACH.</p>
<p>There will be no conflict if an ACH student is currently also in the RSP.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Is there a direct link between ACH and the Humanities Scholarship Programme?</strong></p>
<p>No. The Humanities Scholarship Programme is a scholarship programme offered by the MOE and only Singapore Citizens are eligible. Application to the HSP is open to all interested Year 4 students, and it has its own independent selection process.</p>
<p>If a Singaporean ACH student remains passionate about the humanities, application to the HSP will be a natural next step when they move on to Year 5. It is our hope that the ACH programme will benefit students who are keen to take up the HSP.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> <strong>How are the Humanities subjects differentiated?</strong></p>
<p>Please refer to the respective subject brochures found in the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/talent-development/accelerated-class-for-humanities-ach/subjects-offered/">Subjects Offered</a>&nbsp;section.</p>
<h4><strong>13. What is the mentoring programme?</strong></h4>
<p>The mentoring programme is a two-year mentoring programme that is available to ACH students and provides academic support, and coaching by the Year 5 and 6 students of the Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP). When a student joins the ACH in Year 3, he will be assigned to a Year 5 student who is in the HSP. There will be scheduled mentoring sessions during which the senior students will make themselves available to offer academic advice and assistance.</p>
