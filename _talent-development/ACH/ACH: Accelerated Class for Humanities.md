<p style="text-align: justify;">From 2021, ACS (Independent) has offered an Accelerated Class for Humanities (ACH) to Year 3 Integrated Programme students.  This two-year programme encourages students with high intellectual potential and learning dispositions to pursue a course of study that nurtures their passion in the Humanities.  By fostering a learning environment that deepens an understanding of the interconnectedness of knowledge, challenges assumptions and develops their appreciation of the complexities and intricacies of humanity, the ACH equips learners for the rapidly changing 21st century world and develops the desired ACSian attributes of critical thinking, reflection, communication, cross-cultural skills and global awareness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students of the ACH will be provided with a suite of learning opportunities such as mentoring, service-learning and enriched curricula in Language Arts and the Humanities.  The ACH can also serve as a platform to expose students with potential to MOE’s Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP).</p>
