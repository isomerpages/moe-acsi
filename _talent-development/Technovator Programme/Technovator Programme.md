Started in 2022, the Technovator Programme (TvP) aims to fulfil the tech vision of our school:

“Transforming **_digital natives_** from **_digital users_** to **_digital makers_**”

It is our school’s tech vision that we want all our students to be more than just tech users, but everyone are equipped to create, to innovate, with the help of technology and to be the catalyst of change in our community.  
  
The TvP is the first of its kind in Singapore schools, whereby all Year 1 and 2 students will go through time-tabled lessons, 1hr per week, to learn about the various tech skills.  
  

The curriculum coverage are based on the essential tech skills and top 10 skills identified by World Economic Forum. These identified core tech competencies that will provide the necessary exposure to our students and enable them to be digital makers that will contribute to our society.
