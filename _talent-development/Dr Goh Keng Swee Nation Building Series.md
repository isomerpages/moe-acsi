The Dr Goh Keng Swee Nation Building Series is a signature programme of the ACS (Independent) Humanities Scholarship Programme.

An illustrious ACSian and one of Singapore’s founding fathers, the series was named after Dr Goh as he had made many invaluable contributions to Singapore.

The series was designed to achieve the objectives of Singapore’s National Education (NE), and aims to extend the students’ learning experience beyond the classroom and develop in them a greater understanding of Singapore’s unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities.

A number of activities are organised under this series:

The GKS Future Thinking Challenge is an annual competition organised by ACS(I) in collaboration with the National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS), Prime Minister’s Office, for junior college students. It aims to provide a platform to engage JC students in a systematic way of thinking and examining Singapore’s future. Participants are trained in research and foresight methods to develop future scenarios for Singapore. Winning teams will be awarded prizes and internships, sponsored by NSCS.

“In Conversation With…” dialogue session also provided students the opportunity to engage politicians on topics related to the theme.
