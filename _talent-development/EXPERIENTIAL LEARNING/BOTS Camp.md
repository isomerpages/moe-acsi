The **BOTS CAMP** for Year 2 students is a key signature programme of ACS (Independent). “BOTS” stands for Bonding, Ownership, Teamwork and Self-Awareness. The camp is integral to the school’s holistic approach to education and aims to create a platform to help students:

a\.  develop **B**onding and rapport between staff and students,   
b\.  inculcate a sense of **O**wnership, resilience and adaptive skills when faced with challenges,   
c\.  develop **T**eamwork, effective communication and leadership qualities and   
d\.  develop independence, **S**elf-awareness and greater confidence.

The camp includes activities like team building, obstacles course, amazing race, games, cooking competition and service-learning to eldercare centres. Throughout the camp, students reflect on and share their learning experiences, build character strengths and work with one another to achieve the camp objectives.
