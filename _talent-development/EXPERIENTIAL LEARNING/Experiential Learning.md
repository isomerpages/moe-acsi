Experiential and Outdoor Education (OE) provides rich learning experiences outside the classroom to support our students to develop holistically, building up their resilience and ruggedness. Many of these experiences cannot be replicated in the classroom, but are important to help our students develop 21st century competencies as well as competencies for sustainable outdoor living.
