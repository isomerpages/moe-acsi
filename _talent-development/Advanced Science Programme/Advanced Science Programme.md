ACS(I) offers the Advanced Science Programme to provide a differentiated learning programme for students with exceptional science talents.

This programmes are for pre-university students.


The Advanced Science Programme (ASP) is a differentiated programme to challenge and develop Years 5 – 6 students with special science talents and potential for the international science arena.

The Advanced Science Programme aims to serve the following purposes:

a\.   To provide differentiated learning programme for the students with exceptional science talents.   
b\.  To develop the students’ portfolio in preparation for a possible career in science-related fields.   
c\.  To build a community of keen science learners and foster the culture of collaborative learning

The programme has nurtured students who have represented the school and country in science competitions Olympiads.

The objectives of the programme will be realised through 2 main approaches.

Firstly, the students will be brought through an accelerated curriculum so as to ensure that they are equipped with sufficient concepts to take on challenges of higher order problems in science.

Secondly, the students will be guided to perform intense science research in and out of schools (upon selection by the research institutes). Students will be required to apply concepts learned in class to complete science research projects instead of performing isolated experiments.

Opportunities for exposure to work of scientific agencies are offered, depending on availability.
