The Dr Lee Suan Yew Speaker of the Year Award is a biennial signature programme of the English Language and Literature Department. The school gathers to witness a dazzling display of ACSian eloquence, wit and stage charisma. 9 to 10 finalists are selected after rounds of auditions to battle for the prestigious award in their respective categories: Y1–Y2, Y3–Y4 and Y5-Y6. Each finalist gets attached with a teacher-mentor who helps them prepare for the finals where they will compete in the Prepared Speech and the Visual Impromptu Speech rounds.
