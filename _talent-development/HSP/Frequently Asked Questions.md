<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Humanities Scholarship &amp; Programme (HSP)?</strong>
</p>
<p>The HSP is an interdisciplinary programme tied to the Humanities Scholarship
that is open for application to Years 5 and 6 students at ACS(I).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Humanities Scholarship is awarded at Year 5 for two years. The award
covers an allowance of $1,000 and school fees based on Singapore Citizen's
rates less any subsidies, subject to an annual cap of $2,400, as long as
the student meets the renewal criteria and remains enrolled in the HSP.
Only Singapore Citizens are eligible.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What schools offer the HSP and what makes ACS(I) distinctive among them?</strong>
</p>
<p>Besides ACS(I), the HSP is also being offered at the following institutions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Anglo-Chinese Junior College</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eunoia Junior College</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hwa Chong Institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Junior College</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raffles Institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Temasek Junior College</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Victoria Junior College</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Among these institutions, ACS(I) is the first and only HSP centre
offering the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would the HSP at ACS(I) help me to grow in my passion for interests and abilities? &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The HSP at ACS(I) provides a differentiated academic experience within
a likeminded community passionate about the Humanities. Students engage
in a suite of local enrichment opportunities under the ACrossWorlds initiative
which allow students to apply knowledge, skills and values from the humanities,
to develop perspectives on current and potential issues facing Singapore.</p>
<p>Guest speakers who have visited us in 2023 and 2024 include Mr Martin
Cox, Director General of the John Locke Institute, and Minister of State
Mr Alvin Tan. Students have embarked on diverse learning journeys, such
as on board the USS John P Murtha and the Van Gogh immersive exhibition
in 2023, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Internal
Security Department (ISD) in 2024.&nbsp; These guest lectures and visits
have helped our students to deepen their understanding of diverse fields.</p>
<p>We support students in exploring Singapore’s increasingly vibrant arts
scene by encouraging access to various local and international performances
throughout the year, such as Shakespeare in the Park in 2023, and the Hamilton
and Miss Saigon Musicals in 2024.</p>
<p>Students also participate in an annual HSP Overseas Enrichment Programme
(OEP) centred on Asia, such as Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam. Through
the OEP, students broaden their intellectual horizon through study and
immersion opportunities beyond Singapore.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How would the HSP help me to grow holistically?</strong>
</p>
<p>As values-driven leaders, we want our students to uphold worthy causes,
empathise with others,&nbsp;communicate effectively and exercise integrity.
Our students seek to make a difference for others by understanding their
needs and contributing purposefully to the community. Our HSP students
take part in ACSians in Action (AIA) projects in addition to their class
VIA, such as Project Reperio, an outreach programme to Rohingya refugee
students in Johor, Malaysia.</p>
<p>As an example of class VIA, our Year 5 HSP students in 2023 organised
a carnival with the Crisis Relief Alliance to show our appreciation to
migrant workers in Singapore. Over a span of four weeks, the class tirelessly
collected over 6000 snacks and drinks and 800 pre-loved apparel from students
and teachers. These were provided as prizes for the game booths that the
class had set up at the carnival. The class also set up photo booths and
health screening services for the migrants. Contributing to the welfare
of Singapore’s migrant workers made the experience a meaningful one for
our HSP students.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What subject combination do students study in the HSP?</strong>
</p>
<p>HSP students will offer the following subject combination:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Have done consistently well in school and obtained outstanding results
in their GCE O-Level examinations or Y4 IP Results (&gt;70% overall)</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there opportunities to interact with the rest of the cohort given that HSP lessons take place in a dedicated classroom?</strong>
</p>
<p>Lessons for HSP students will take place in a dedicated classroom, which
fosters a thriving and vibrant community knitted together by a common interest
in the Humanities. This said, there is an abundance of opportunities outside
of the programme to meet other students, such as in CCA and school events.</p>
