<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does the Advanced Class for Integrative Studies differ from the HSP and what are its requirements?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Advanced Class&nbsp;for Integrative Studies (ACis) will be launched
in 2025, for Year 5 students enrolled in the two-year IBDP at ACS(I).&nbsp;The
ACis aims to help students develop a deeper understanding of the Humanities
subjects through structured enrichment opportunities. Students will also
engage in inter-disciplinary learning through these enrichment opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ACis differs from the HSP in that applicants go through an internal
application and selection process. Open to all nationalities, the ACis
provides an immersive academic environment without monetary stipends.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What subject combination do students study in the ACis?</strong>
</p>
<p>ACis students will offer the following subject combination:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HL Economics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HL History or Geography</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HL Mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SL Language &amp; Literature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SL Biology or Chemistry or Physics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SL CLB/MLB/TLB/Spanish Ab</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Relevant subject pre-requisites may apply.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is eligible for the ACis?</strong>
</p>
<p>The ACis is open for application to students of all nationalities who:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Have done consistently well in school and obtained outstanding results
in their GCE O-Level examinations or Y4 IP Results (&gt;70% overall)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtained at least a B3 in English Language or equivalent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have good co-curricular activities record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have good conduct record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there opportunities to interact with the rest of the cohort given that ACis lessons will take place in a dedicated classroom?</strong>
</p>
<p>Lessons for ACis students will take place in a dedicated classroom, which
fosters a thriving and vibrant community knitted together by a common interest
in the Humanities. This said, there is an abundance of opportunities outside
of the programme to meet other students, such as in CCA and school events.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the differences between HL Literature and HL Language &amp; Literature?</strong>
</p>
<p>The English language is crucial to both courses but is treated more broadly
in the English A: Language and Literature course. Literary texts are the
sole focus of the English A: Literature course, while the English A: Language
&amp; Literature course examines both literary and non-literary texts.</p>
