The Trailblazer Programme for Year 3 students takes place during structured time in curriculum. Students gather in groups according to their interests. Groups of similar interest are gathered to form communities.

Students are challenged to create a tangible product within a challenging time frame. In doing so, students bring forth their skills and talents, which can also be picked up through the Pathfinder Programme in their earlier years, to create an innovative product that serves society.

Products that have been created include a game for Alzheimer patients to help them in their memory, a product to reduce injury during basketball game, a ‘smart’ water bottle and an original song about the school.
