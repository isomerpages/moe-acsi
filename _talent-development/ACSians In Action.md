The ACSians-In-Action (AIA) programme encourages Year 5 students to develop the entrepreneur dare by allowing them to take ownership in an overseas service-based project. The programme is non-compulsory.

As part of the pre-trip planning, students independently conceptualise and present their project proposal to a school panel. Students liaise directly with the beneficiaries to truly understand how they can contribute towards their needs and aspirations, making for a much more meaningful exchange. In one instance, students sold badges and stickers <a href="/files/Talent%20Development/AIA/ACSians-in-Action-Yogyakarta-Indonesia-.pdf" target="_blank">to raise funds to buy cows</a>!

Teams whose projects have been approved typically embark on service learning trip in Term 3 or after their examinations with their teacher-advisors.
