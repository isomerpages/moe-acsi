The ACSians-In-Action (AIA) programme encourages Year 5 students to develop the entrepreneur dare by allowing them to take ownership in an overseas service-based project. The programme is non-compulsory.

As part of the pre-trip planning, students independently conceptualise and present their project proposal to a school panel. Students liaise directly with the beneficiaries to truly understand how they can contribute towards their needs and aspirations, making for a much more meaningful exchange. In one instance, students sold badges and stickers [to raise funds to buy cows](https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ACSians-in-Action-Yogyakarta-Indonesia-.pdf)!

Teams whose projects have been approved typically embark on service learning trip in Term 3 or after their examinations with their teacher-advisors.
