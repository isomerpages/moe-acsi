<p>In August 2023, ACS(I) was accredited as a <strong>‘Athlete-Friendly Education Centre’ </strong>&nbsp;by
World Academy of Sports. This allows the school to offer a 3-year IB diploma
programme for our high-performing student athletes.</p>
<p>This extended study option aims to allow our student-athletes to balance
the twin rigours of their high performing sport and the IB course of studies.</p>
