Dr Lee Li Eng Speaker of the Year Series
----------------------------------------

The biennial Dr Lee Li Eng Speaker of the Year Award provides a platform for our students to showcase their oratorical skills in Chinese in a contest of eloquence and wit.

This Chinese Speech Contest which started from Year 2000 showcases students’ oratorical skills in Chinese in a contest of eloquence and wit. Through the Contest, we hope to instil in our students the importance and appreciation of Chinese Language and Culture.

The Contest consists of three categories, namely Lower Sec (Y1-Y2), Upper Sec (Y3-Y6) and Open category (Chinese Scholars and others whose 1st Language is Chinese).

Contestants are nominated by Chinese teachers and selected by the two preliminary rounds and after which three finalists are chosen for the respective category. Finalists compete based on prepared speech and impromptu speech rounds.
