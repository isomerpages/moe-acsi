The Pathfinder Programme is a Year 1 and 2 programme designed to help students identify their passion and develop their creative-making skills.

Aimed to bring about the joy of learning, the programme is divided into two main tracks â€“ Digital Maker and Maker track.

Each track comprises different programmes to suit the interests of the students. The offering of programmes within each track are designed such that they have relevance to skillsets that can help our students to thrive, like creation of digital collage, programming skills, basic cooking skill, etc. Students within a course also come from different classes, fostering stronger interaction across the entire level.
