<p>The HiF(IV)E Programme seeks to equip Year 4 IP students with future-ready skills and competencies through a dynamic and engaging learning experience. The name of the programme ‘HiF(IV)E’&nbsp;symbolizes the Year 4 IP saying ‘Hi’ to Year 5 as they transit from the secondary to the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme. Over the course of the programme, students have the opportunity to develop life skills, explore educational options, and experience work situations. While the programme is compulsory, students are empowered to exercise student agency to customise their HiF(IV)E experience.</p>
<p>Overall Learning Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>To equip students with knowledge, skills, and learning experiences to prepare them for the IBDP</li>
<li>To provide students opportunities to explore choices in terms of work, life and learning beyond the IBDP</li>
<li>To provide students opportunities to be attuned to the needs of the community and give back using their expertise and talents</li>
</ul>
<p>The HiF(IV)E Programme comprises 3 key components,&nbsp;namely Academic, Career Opportunities and Guidance (COG), and the Empowered ACSian.</p>
