ACS (Independent) offers the Music Elective Programme (MEP) for students who demonstrate both academic and musical abilities. The programme aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical faculties as well as creativity.

**Years 1 – 4**

The MEP is a four-year course that prepares students for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Music Examination. MEP students in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) will offer Music (MEP) as a subject and sit for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Music Examination at the end of their fourth year.

**Years 5 – 6**

Year 5 and 6 ACS (I) students may apply for the Music Elective Scholarships. Successful applicants must offer IBDP Higher Level Music as one of their subjects under the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP).
