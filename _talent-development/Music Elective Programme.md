ACS (Independent) offers the Music Elective Programme (MEP) for students who demonstrate both academic and musical abilities. The programme aims to develop students’ conceptual and analytical faculties as well as creativity.

**Years 1 – 4**

The MEP is a four-year course that prepares students for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Music Examination. MEP students in Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) will offer Higher Music (MEP) as a subject and sit for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Music Examination at the end of their fourth year.

**Years 5 – 6**      

Year 5 students with relevant musical aptitudes may choose Music (Higher Level) as part of the Group 6 International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) subject. As part of the MEP, all Year 5 Music (Higher Level) students may apply for the Music Elective Scholarship (MES).
