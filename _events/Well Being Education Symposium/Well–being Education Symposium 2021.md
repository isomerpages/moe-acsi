ACS (Independent) is organising a Well-being Education (WE) symposium on **31 March (Wednesday)**.

The theme for the symposium is **Promoting Character & Well-Being in the 21****st** **Century.**

Our founder Bishop Oldham’s vision for ACS, apart from providing good academic education for students, believed strongly that the school should also strive to teach students good morals and habits consistent with strong values.

In recent years, schools in Singapore have experienced a growth in mental health issues among our students such as stress, anxiety, self-harm, and depression. Old threats take on new complexions in the digital world, like cyberbullying and fake news.

Through this WE Symposium, we hope to advance the principles and practices of well-being among educators in Singapore as we learn about the latest research, theory, best practices and practical applications from educators and experts.

 **WHO should attend?**

This symposium is for anyone interested in well-being education. This includes school leaders, teachers, researchers and consultants in the education space.

**WHO will be sharing?**

Anchoring the symposium are two keynote speakers with expertise in the field. They are:

1.  **Dr Daniel Fung**, Chief Executive Officer (Designate) of Singapore’s Institute of Mental Health (IMH); and
2.  **Dr Ng Pak Tee**, Associate Professor of Policy, Curriculum and Leadership (PCL) at the National Institute of Education (NIE)

Participants can also look forward to over 30 workshops within the breakout sessions where educators and practicing members from MOE institutions, government agencies and non-governmental organisations will share and draw up practical, cross-industry solutions implementable in the present and future.

**Symposium registration fee**

SGD $10

The keynote sessions will be streamed live, and breakout sessions will be held online using Microsoft Teams.

**Registration will be closed on 28 February 2021.**

Information on how to access the keynote sessions and workshops will be provided to all successful participants after registration closes.
