Economics is an exciting, dynamic subject that allows students to develop an understanding of the complexities and interdependence of economic activities in a rapidly changing world. At the heart of economic theory is the problem of scarcity. Owing to scarcity, choices have to be made.

The course, at both HL and SL, uses economic theories, models and key concepts to examine the ways in which these choices are made: at the level of producers and consumers in individual markets (microeconomics); at the level of the government and the national economy (macroeconomics); and at an international level, where countries are becoming increasingly interdependent (the global economy).

It allows students to explore models, theories and key concepts, and apply them, using empirical data, through the examination of real-world issues. The nine key concepts are as follow

**University Courses and Careers**

 A background in Economics can lead to advanced study and research in fields such as Finance, Public Policy, Business & Management as well as International Studies.  It is also useful in the study of Law, Medicine and many other disciplines.

Do note that some top overseas universities require a good score in <u>HL Mathematics</u> as a pre-requisite in order to pursue Economics as a major.
