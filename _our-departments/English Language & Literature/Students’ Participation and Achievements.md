**Literature Seminar**

<p style="text-align: justify;">On 21 August 2021, 5 groups of students from 3.16 Habakkuk, 4.09 Elijah, and 4.11 Stephen presented their Literary Research during the Literature Seminar. Organised by the Gifted Education Branch (GEB) of MOE, this programme aims to stimulate students’ interest in Literature by exposing them to literary issues beyond our normal curriculum and classroom content. This experience also presented them with the opportunity to enrich their understanding of the literary discipline. The English Language and Literature Department is proud of all the teams for their sterling efforts!</p>

To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!

**Year 3 Individual Oral Presentation: Digital Story-telling**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Individual Oral Presentation (IOP) was an assignment given to the 2020 Year 3 cohort of Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) in July. This project consisted of a 100-150 word poem and an accompanying video of 2-3 minutes. We are proud to say that after weeks of sleepless nights, battling the crutches of an eager Hypnos, some of our students blew our socks (but not our masks!) off. Their creative pieces were displayed in Clementi Public Library, as well as Jurong West Public Library. Below, you will find pictures of the exhibitions, as well as two videos by Bryan Cheung Jia Jie (3.11 Elisha) and Ryan Daniel Chua (3.14 Obadiah). We hope you enjoy.</p>
