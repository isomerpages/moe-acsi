_“Our primary goal in the Literature curriculum is not to make literary scholars of all our students. It is to make them readers and writers, independent and self-reliant thinkers who employ language and literature to enrich their lives.”_ – Robert E. Probst

ACS (Independent)’s English Language curriculum in school aims to help pupils become independent lifelong learners, creative thinkers and problem solvers who can communicate effectively in English.

There are many curricular and co-curricular activities for pupils to use English in a variety of situations and contexts. Pupils will read widely, learn how to analyse and evaluate language and the media, and respond creatively to problems and new technology.
