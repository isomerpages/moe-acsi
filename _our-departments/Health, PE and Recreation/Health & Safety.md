As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure students’ health and safety, parents are required to complete an  **annual health declaration form**  on behalf of their child.

This information is important in helping the school to deliver safer lessons and programmes, especially those which involve physical activity and sports. Throughout the year, any change in your child’s medical fitness should be communicated to the school in writing as soon as possible.

The school organises an  **annual medical screening exercise**  for all newly admitted students to undergo a series of non-invasive screening tests. The battery of tests, which includes a resting ECG, are an added safety measure and are compulsory for students who are involved in and represent the school in sports and/or participate in vigorous physical activities.

All other students are encouraged to opt for the screening. Students who are in need of financial support for this medical screening may seek assistance through their teachers.
