Physical education provides the opportunity for our pupils to be involved in physically active, socially integrated and emotionally stable activities. Our sports programme plays an important role in our students’ holistic development.

The Health, Physical Education and Recreation (HPER) Department co-ordinates the overall running and coordination of the Physical Fitness Test and the co-curricular activities of the School. It conducts skills tests for all sports available, and matches talented students with the most appropriate CCA.
