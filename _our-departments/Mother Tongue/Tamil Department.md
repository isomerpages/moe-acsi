<h4><strong>A Note from the Head of Department</strong></h4>
<p>The Tamil Language Department has its interests aligned to the school’s
motto, ‘The Best Is Yet To Be.’ It focuses on the holistic development
of students, with the aim of inculcating the Tamil culture and identity
deep in the hearts of the students. We also strongly believe in ‘Not failure,
but the low aim is crime,’ and thus we provide opportunities for students
to excel in all aspects of life. Our students are the living examples of
the Tamil Language Department’s success, showing their bright colours in
various fields around the nation. We are also doing our part in spreading
the Tamil language and culture among the Singaporean community.</p>
