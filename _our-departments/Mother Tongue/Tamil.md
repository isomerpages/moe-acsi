##### _The proportion of Indian students from English-speaking homes has doubled. These students have limited exposure to Tamil before they enter school and start learning the language. These students would also have limited opportunities to use Tamil in their homes. Therefore, our teaching approach will have to be modified, or even changed fundamentally, to ensure that such students learn the language in a manner, and at a pace, that meets their need, with constant motivation and encouragement as they progress.” – Minister S Iswaran_
