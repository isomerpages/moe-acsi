**Student Programmes**

ICS:  
The Indian Cultural Society (ICS) is an enriching platform for ACS Independent students to showcase their talents and at the same time reinforce their knowledge of Indian Culture. Led by the Year 5s & 6s, the ICS works closely with the Tamil Language teachers in organizing structured events every year, with the aim of presenting students with the opportunity of experiencing the Tamil festive atmosphere, as well as to partake in competitions that bolster their appreciation for the Tamil language.

Kalai Vizha:  
Kalai Vizha is a series of several Tamil literary competitions, a signature programme organized by Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Indian Cultural Society. Being one of the most highly-anticipated competitions in the Tamil student community, another important feature of Kalai Vizha 2016 is its added features of a variety of Tamil-related competitions. Kalai Vizha is organized to promote the use of the Tamil language amongst our student population and the participants. Kalai Vizha is also a cultural event that promotes knowledge and awareness of our Tamil culture to our own students as well as our participants. We believe that organizing this competition would allow us to stay rooted to our mother tongue language.

MT Fortnight:  
The Tamil Language Department, working closely with the Ministry of Education, leads the Mother Tongue Fortnight activities, where a series of events will be conducted during curriculum hours, allowing students to participate in fun and enriching activities, enhancing their understanding of the Tamil culture. The MT Fortnight is conducted with its interests aligned to the vision of our forefathers, a vision about Singapore being a vibrant bilingual community.
