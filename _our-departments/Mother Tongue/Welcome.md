#### **A Note from the Head of Department**

The Tamil Language Department has its interests aligned to the school’s motto, ‘The Best Is Yet To Be.’ It focuses on the holistic development of students, with the aim of inculcating the Tamil culture and identity deep in the hearts of the students. We also strongly believe in ‘Not failure, but the low aim is crime,’ and thus we provide opportunities for students to excel in all aspects of life. Our students are the living examples of the Tamil Language Department’s success, showing their bright colours in various fields around the nation. We are also doing our part in spreading the Tamil language and culture among the Singaporean community.
