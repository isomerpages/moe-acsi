*   are ranked among the top 10% of the PSLE; or
*   are in the top 11% – 30% band who meet the language criteria (i.e. an A\* grade in the MTL or at least a Merit in the HMTL)

may opt to study MTL or HMTL at secondary level.

**2.** Schools also have the flexibility to allow pupils who do not meet the above criteria to offer HMTL, if they are assessed to have exceptional ability in MTL and are able to do HMTL without affecting their performance in other subjects.

**3.** Pupils eligible for HMTL will be invited to apply for these programmes immediately after the release of the PSLE results.

**4.** Pupils taking HMTL are eligible for the following incentives. These measures are put in place to give pupils more flexibility in the study of two languages and thus help to produce a greater number of effectively bilingual pupils in the future.

**5.** A pupil who passes both English and HMTL at the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination and who qualifies for admission to a Junior College (JC)/Millennia Institute (MI) will be given a concession of two points in his application to the JC/MI of his choice. Priority for admission to a JC/MI will be given to a pupil with English and HMTL who scores the same number of points as one with English and MTL.

**6.** For entry to a JC/MI, a grade of E8 in HMTL is considered to be equivalent to a grade of D7 in MTL. Therefore, a pupil who scores at least C6 in English Language and E8 in HMTL will be considered to have satisfied the language requirements for admission to a JC/MI.

**7.** A pupil, who obtains at least a grade of D7 in HMTL at the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination, will be considered to have satisfied the MTL requirement for admission to the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University.

**8.** the end of Secondary Three, an O Level pupil studying HMTL will be allowed to sit for the GCE ‘O’ Level MTL paper. If the pupil is unable to cope with both English and HMTL, he will be allowed to switch to English and MTL.

**10.** IP students who choose to offer HMTL will sit for the HMTL GCE ‘O’ Level Examination at the end of Year 4.
