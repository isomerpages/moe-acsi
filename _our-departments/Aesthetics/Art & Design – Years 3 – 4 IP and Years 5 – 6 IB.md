Introduction
------------

Life and education are a journey where we **OBSERVE, INVESTIGATE, EXPLORE, and DISCOVER**.  It all makes an imprint on the mind of the person who experiences this journey. The ACS(I) **IP/IB Visual Art Programme** facilitates, equips, and nurtures the creative mind to **engage with and respond to its surrounding stimuli giving birth to tangible imprints.**  These imprints reflect the journey of fueled and engaged “creative engines” as they travel the ever-changing landscape.

### Syllabus

The objective of the **IP/IB Visual Art Programme** is to unlock powerful new dimensions of learning and expression, enabling our students to travel from the familiar into unexplored territory on their way to an unknown destination. This objective is birthed as each student learns to integrate thinking skills, observation skills, and various tools of expression (media skills) in order to “breathe life” into some of their unique imprints that have been gathered on their journey. **These processes are central to Art Education at ACS(I).**

 …developing and facilitating **creative, analytical, and critical thinking skills,**
