Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) is one of two MEP centres that offer the programme to students who are not enrolled in schools that offer the MEP or Enhanced Music Programme (EMP). Both centres take in students of both genders.

Interested students can apply for the programme offered by the MEP centres _through their secondary schools._

The lesson day and timing for students enrolled in ACS (Independent) are as follows:

*   Sec 1 – Thursday, 3.30pm – 5.30pm
*   Sec 2 – Thursday, 3.30pm – 6.00pm
*   Sec 3 – Friday, 3.00pm – 6.30pm
*   Sec 4 – Friday, 3.00pm – 7.00pm (inc. 30 min break)

Prior to application, students are to work with their secondary schools to ensure that their school schedules and commitment allow them to participate fully in the MEP. Students who are selected and admitted into the MEP will need to commit to the programme for 4 years, as withdrawal from the MEP requires the approval of Arts Education Branch, MOE

For more information on MEP centres and the application process, please refer to MOE websites and the Information Sheet for Applicants, which will be made available through the student’s secondary school at the start of each academic year.
