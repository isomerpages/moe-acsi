The General Music Programme curriculum is a compulsory curriculum component for Year 1 & 2 students. The curriculum aims to cultivate students’ love for music while furthering their musical knowledge and aptitude.

Students learn a wide variety of music from pop to classical and to ethnic music from different parts of the world. They will also learn at least one instrument (keyboards, voice, guitar, and/or drums) over the course of the 2-year programme.

Running in tandem with the General Music Programme is the **Arts Education Programme (AEP)**, which allows students to experience music live via public concerts (e.g. classical music concert at Esplanade) and in-school performances by various established external performance arts groups.
