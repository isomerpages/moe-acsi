During physical education, students acquire a variety of skills and knowledge that involve them in healthy physical activities. Students will learn the very basic skills and rules necessary to participate in the games taught at recreation level. Through PE, we hope every ACSian will develop a lifelong interest in sports and games.

HPER also provides opportunity for intra-school competition through events such as the annual Swimming Championships, Track & Field Championships and Cross Country Championships.
