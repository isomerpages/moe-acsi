Physical education provides the opportunity for our pupils to be involved in physically active, socially integrated and emotionally stable activities. Our sports programme plays an important role in our studentsâ€™ holistic development.

The Health, Physical Education and Recreation (HPER) Department co-ordinates the overall running and coordination of the Physical Fitness Test and the co-curricular activities of the School. It conducts skills tests for all sports available, and matches talented students with the most appropriate CCA.
