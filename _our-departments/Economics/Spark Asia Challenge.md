We are pleased to announce that ACS(Independent)’s Economics and Business Management Department is honoured to host the inaugural Spark Asia Challenge amongst pre-university students.

Supported by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Singapore Management University (SMU), the competition leverages on relevant economic concepts and/or Business Management principles.

Through this platform, Spark Asia Challenge seeks to support innovative new ideas and nurture practices that create positive, sustainable and scalable social change in our community. In addition, it provides a supporting avenue for students keen to promote positive social change to showcase their proposals and action plans to a panel of judges.

For 2021, the theme for Spark Asia Challenge is focused on increased sustainability in area of food waste in Singapore.
