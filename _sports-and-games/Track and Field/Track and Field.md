**Information on our CCA:**

The ACS(I) Track & Field Team is a competitive athletics squad that trains and competes in a wide range of events across sprints, hurdles, relays, jumps, and throws. In track events, our athletes specialise in the 100m, 200m, 400m, sprint hurdles, and relays, while our field athletes excel in long jump, triple jump, high jump, shot put, discus, and javelin.

We believe strongly in nurturing the passions of our athletes and focusing on their character development in the pursuit of excellence and when facing challenges.

Over the years, our team has done consistently well in the National School Games, particularly in the relay events. ACS(I) has also produced numerous athletes who have made their mark on the regional and local sporting scenes. The dedication of our athletes, alongside their quest for excellence, is unmistakable.
