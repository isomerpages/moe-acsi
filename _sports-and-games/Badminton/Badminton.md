**“Ubuntu!”**

_(translation: African for “I am what I am because of who we all are”)_

The ACS Badminton has had a long and illustrious history. There was a time when the school had no badminton courts to play on, and then to happy memories in the sports hall above the swimming pool at Barker Road where we trained at even after moving to our new campus, to the cavernous Multi-Purpose Sports hall at Dover Road from 1993 and eventually to the state-of-the-art facilities we currently possess, the team has certainly come a long way.

Our passion in the game has never wavered.  We have nurtured players and coaches who have represented the school at local competitions such as the Zonal Badminton championships and National Badminton Championships; to regional ones such as the ASEAN Schools Badminton Championships, ASEAN School Games and the Asian Schools Badminton Championships, and to the pinnacle of the sport in the international arena such as the SEA Games, Thomas Cup, Olympics, Commonwealth Games and the prestigious All England Badminton Championships.

What carries the team through now is the belief in “Ubuntu!’, an African word which when translated, means “I am what I am because of who we all are” has been the rallying cry and inspiration of our Badminton Team.  The school has done well and will continue to do so because we believe that through the relentless intense training together, failure is to be accepted together and success is not to be celebrated alone. Through the camaraderie forged on and off the courts, we learn that someone always has our back and that feeling is irreplaceable.
