<h4>Matthew Loo (1.10 – 2022)</h4>
<p>In my primary school, I had many sports CCAs, namely swimming, tennis
and football. I focused on football and played for the school in National
School Games (NSG). I was quite fit and did well in swim meets and sports
days. However, due to the circuit breaker in 2020, I could not play football
and did not exercise regularly, and thus my fitness level decreased.</p>
<p>A friend introduced me to a kayaking course called Kids-In-A-Kayak (KIAK),
which allowed children to experience the joy of kayaking and for them to
develop an interest in the sport. Sure enough, I enjoyed it and paddled
every Sunday. The weekly paddling sessions allowed me to get better at
the sport, while also allowing me to increase my fitness level. I enjoyed
canoeing so much that I decided that I would take up canoeing as my CCA
in secondary school.
<br>When I came to ACSI, I took up canoeing as my CCA. I trained 4 times a
week, which took up most of my time. Thus, to manage my studies and my
training, I had to manage my time well. By planning my weekly schedule
every Saturday, I balanced out my training and my studies, thus allowing
me to focus on both. I could keep up with all the work assigned, while
also training hard.</p>
<p>During my training, I learnt many things from the coach, which helped
me improve my technique, allowing me to become a better paddler. Not only
did I improve in canoeing, but I also developed strong friendships amongst
the canoeing team. In April I also had the chance to represent the school
in (NSG). This gave me lots of experience in competing for the school and
helped me to better enjoy racing.</p>
<p>I benefitted tremendously from Canoeing in ACSI. I got physically stronger,
and my fitness level has increased due to the many training sessions. It
has allowed me to better understand the importance of time management,
which will be useful wherever I go, and I have forged strong friendships
with my teammates who always encourage and support me, always helping me
along the way. Canoeing has taught me many lessons and values as well,
such as unity, resilience, unity and much more.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoy canoeing, and the CCA has allowed me to become more fit,
forge strong friendships, have better time management skills, and learn
good values.</p>

<h4>Tyler Tan (1.11 – 2022)</h4>
<p>In primary school, I wasn’t super fit, or neither was I very strong. The
CCA I took up was dance, and there was only training once a week, and besides
that, I led a sedentary lifestyle and did not do much exercise at all.
My fitness level was very low, and I was lethargic even during basic exercise.</p>
<p>During school orientation, we had to take part in the sports bazaar and
tryout for the different sports CCAs. At that time, I was contemplating
joining chess club, as I knew I would not do very well in a sports CCAs
due to my fitness level. Then I stumbled upon canoeing. The sport was interesting
and something that I had never heard of before. I was reluctant to go for
the tryouts, but my mother convinced me to. I wanted to join canoeing as
I knew that if I trained hard enough, my fitness would improve and I also
wanted to join a sports CCA. Another reason is that some of my friends
were joining canoeing as well.</p>
<p>During the tryouts, we went to MacRitchie reservoir and firstly, coach
Ismail taught us how to use the boat and the names of its components. The
next few sessions were comprised of just paddling around the bay and some
races. The races were very fun and competitive. We also had to take a theory
test to get selected. After a week or so, we were told that we were accepted
into the CCA and I was quite ecstatic.</p>
<p>During the year, it was quite difficult to manage the training and my
huge secondary school work load. When I transitioned to secondary school,
I could already barely manage the incrementally huge amount of homework.
On top of that, the canoeing training was three times a week. The largest
struggle was coursework season when I had to juggle training and multiple
calls. I found the solution to this issue was to have good time management.
With good time management, I could go for training, have calls and even
some rest time for myself to relax.</p>
<p>I have benefitted from the canoeing experience in multiple ways. I have
become a bit more fit and I have also gained many precious friendships
that I am going to treasure for a lifetime. Not only that, I have found
something I can be passionate about and something that can make good use
of my time instead of me lazing at home.</p>

<h4>Evan Ching (1.12 – 2022)</h4>
<p>Hello, I’m Evan Ching. I was from ACSJ before I joined ACSI. During my
primary school days, my fitness level was only average. I used to be in
many CCAs such as Table Tennis, Football and Chess. However, I never really
enjoyed these CCAs because they did not give me the adrenaline as kayaking
gives.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was introduced to kayaking by a neighbor. I joined a program
called Kids-In-A-Kayak (KIAK) where primary school students are exposed
to kayaking as the primary schools did not have kayaking as CCA. When I
had my first trial for KIAK, I did not know that it would lead me this
far. As we got better, the intensity of the trainings and the number of
trainings increased. We were also participating in different types of competitions
like sprints and marathons.</p>
<p>I entered ACSI through kayaking DSA. I wanted to stay in this sport as
kayaking is very different from many other sports. This is because kayaking
is water sport and we can paddle at MacRitchie Reservoir while many other
people are not able to. I also like the intensity and competitiveness that
comes with kayaking.</p>
<p>During the discovery camp, we were brought around the school by our seniors
to try out different CCAs to see which one is best for us. I remember when
we were brought to the Canoeing/Kayaking booth, we were allowed to try
the equipment. I remember my classmates all having fun with the machines
as they considered giving the CCA a chance.</p>
<p>When I started secondary school, I was training 4 to 5 times a week including
KIAK. Thus, I had very little time to study. At first, I had a hard time
trying to catch up with my peers in terms of my grades. However, after
my seniors gave me good advice on time management, I was able to be on
par with my classmates. I learn how to do a good study plan and schedule
and I follow to it closely. Also, I have to spend less time gaming and
devices as time is precious to me.</p>
<p>I have benefitted alot from Kayaking through the years. I have forged
many good friendships, learnt the importance of perseverance and endurance.
I also learnt to never give up during a race.</p>
<p>Overall, you should give this CCA a chance like how many of us did. Few
have regretted it.

<h4>Joshua Prince (2.01 – 2022)</h4>
<p>My name is Joshua Prince and I am a member of the ACS(I) Canoeing Team.
This testimonial is about my personal experience in this CCA.</p>
<p>When I was in primary school, I was in a badminton CCA. At that point
of time, badminton was my all time favorite sport. I would play badminton
at least 4 times a week. Despite being in a CCA such as badminton, I never
really did any exercise rather than the sport itself, which made me very
unfit.</p>
<p>When I was in secondary 1, I was devastated when I was not accepted into
the badminton CCA. Me personally, I prefer sport CCAs over clubs and societies.
During the sports bazaar, that was when I was exposed to the canoeing sport.
Since I had no other option, I thought I would give this sport a shot.
I have never regretted that decision.</p>
<p>Initially, there was a physical test that I had to pass in order to join
the CCA. Due to my lack of physical fitness, I was unable to pass the test.
However, the coaches and teachers in charge gave me a chance to be in the
CCA. Given this opportunity, I tried to ensure that the coaches and teachers
in charge would not regret letting me in the CCA.</p>
<p>Given the number of training days a week, keeping up with my studies was
definitely a problem. However, like most things in life, managing my time
properly came with practice. After trying a few methods and ways to save
more time wherever I could, I was able to keep up with my studies.</p>
<p>After going for so many trainings, I have definitely benefited from them.
From this CCA alone, I have learnt how to manage my time better, how to
push myself to my limits, how to work efficiently, and how to work as one
Canoeing team. Not only that, but my fitness level and my leadership skills
have improved tremendously. Joining the ACS(I) Canoeing team was the best
decision I have made.</p>

<h4>Valen Ng (2.01 – 2022)</h4>
<p>I am Valen Ng from 2.01 and I was from ACS(J), which I transferred to
from a neighborhood school in Primary 5. In Primary School, I took up Modern
Dance and Tennis as my CCAs in my old neighborhood school and ACS(J) respectively.
Although I was in a Sports CCA, I was extremely unfit as I was not committed
to attending Tennis CCA due to my laziness, only attending training twice
per month instead of twice per week. Despite having run with my father
since Primary 1, I lost the will to run anymore in Primary 5, causing my
stamina to decline rapidly. Further worsened by an unhealthy lifestyle,
eating fast food at least twice a week, I became fat and extremely out
of shape. This could be shown from being able to run 1.6km in 8.16 minutes
in my Primary 4 NAPFA test to being unable to jog 3 rounds around the track
without being exhausted after the first round at the start of Secondary
1.</p>
<p>During the Sports Bazaar in the Secondary 1 Orientation Camp for the first
week of school, I was shown a video displaying what Canoeing was about.
Mixed with the seniors mention that Canoeing was beginner friendly, I soon
felt that this CCA was the right one for me to join. Although I was selected
for trial for other CCAs such as Track and Field as well as Air Rifle,
I knew that there were faster runners who trained much more than me in
Primary School and that there were more gifted people than me at Air Rifle.
The fact that Canoeing catered to beginners and that it showed improvement
in one’s physical fitness truly made me want to become a member of this
CCA team.</p>
<p>Originally, at the CCA trial for Canoeing, I was one of the worst participants,
being one of the extremely unfit ones. I performed very poorly compared
to others in terms of my physical fitness, not being able to do pull-ups
while others could or do many pushups whereas I could do only a few of
improper form. Therefore, I was rejected initially to join the Canoeing
team. However, I really wanted to join Canoeing as it was a sport like
no other, so I made an appeal to the teacher-in-charge, Mr Jeffery Tan.
After consideration from him, I managed to join the team.</p>
<p>Canoeing is a CCA that you really need to commit to perform well in the
sport, with training 4 times a week which lasts around 3 hours each training.
This was a drastic change to my slothful attitude towards CCA training.
This caused me to lag my classmates in assignments and work, leading to
a drop in my results in the first term of my Secondary 1 year. I knew that
if I wanted to do well in this CCA, I had to get my studies and schedule
up to fully commit. I started cutting down time spent on playing games
or lazing around after training to add more time for my studies and revision.
As well as increasing the amount of time to focus on my studies, I focused
on efficiency during study sessions, by studying more with my friends who
could help me in areas I was lacking. This improved my studies in submitting
work and results while ingraining in me self-discipline and time management.</p>
<p>Canoeing has given me many benefits. Firstly, I have made many friends
in this team, be it my seniors or my fellow cohort teammates. Many amazing
memories have been made in Canoeing such as new PBs or joyful times. Secondly,
I am much more physically fit than before. I grew an extreme amount from
149cm at the start of Secondary 1 to 162cm to present day alongside having
slimmed down for the better. Fitness wise, from being exhausted after jogging
1 round around the track, I can now run 9km with my father once again and
have a PB of 10.07 minutes for 2.4km in my NAPFA test. From not being able
to even lift myself 1cm from hanging on the pullup bar, I can now do 5
and increasing. I can now do proper pushups continuously, formerly which
I would cry after doing 10 pushups which were improperly done. Lastly,
Canoeing has taught and instilled in me many important life lessons like
teamwork, comradery, responsibility and my personal leadership and communication
skills.</p>
<p>Overall, Canoeing has profoundly changed my life, making my experience
in Secondary School much more fruitful and worthwhile. I am glad to have
persevered no matter the low points and to seize the opportunity to join
Canoeing as my first choice of CCA. Even if I were fit and strong from
the start of Secondary School, undoubtedly, I would still join the ACS(I)
Canoeing team.</p>

<h4>Jerry Zhang (2.13 – 2022)</h4>
<p>In primary school I was pretty involved in sports. I was in a sports CCA
from Pri 1 all the way to Pri 5. In Pri 1 I joined the swimming CCA as
I generally liked water sports and I enjoyed swimming. Then in Pri 2 I
was selected to join the Rugby CCA through a trial that everyone had to
go through since ACSP was a rugby school. In Pri 5 I joined basketball,
and in half a year I made it to the developmental team, which was the future
school team.</p>
<p>My fitness was not the best when I first started my sporting journey.
I was a chubby, slightly overweight kid for half of my time in primary
school. Somehow, I slimmed down and got fit during Pri 3 to Pri 4, probably
due to rugby training. After that, my fitness level became one of the best,
and my running stamina was top notch.</p>
<p>Coming into secondary school, I was at a loss for what sports to choose.
I knew I would not go for rugby or basketball since I no longer loved the
sport. My mom suggested that I try out canoeing since it wasn’t an option
in primary school. I thought about how every time we go to MacRitchie Reservoir
to hike, we would always see the students training in the reservoir, capping
in the bay area, their joyful shouts and screams filling the morning air.
Furthermore, I enjoyed doing recreational kayaking in the reservoirs, coupled
with the unmatched scenery in the reservoir, it was an easy choice. During
the sports bazaar I went straight for canoeing, turning down the repeated
offer from the rugby coach, as well as many others. I knew I only wanted
to join canoeing, and no other CCAs enticed me. I tried my best in both
the fitness test, as well as the practical test on site in MacRitchie,
and got accepted into the sport.</p>
<p>Getting into the sport was the easy part, the responsibilities needed
to continue with the CCA was the hard part. There are 4 training sessions
per week, and we are expected to turn up to all these training sessions.
This was made clear to us by our teacher in charge on the first day of
CCA. Training would usually end at 6:30 while the other CCAs would end
at 5:30, as we needed time to travel to the reservoir for training. This
had a mental toll on us as we knew that while we were still hard at training,
every other CCA was already released, going home and relaxing. Moreover,
we had an hour less after school each day to catch up on schoolwork and
revision, or to spend time relaxing. The training pushing us to the limits
every session did not help either as after training I would sometimes collapse
on the bed and fall asleep before getting anything done.</p>
<p>Suddenly getting thrown into this was a culture shock. The first month
or two were the hardest to get accustomed to. The seniors were tough on
us, trying to push us past our limits and make us disciplined, to not give
up. We tried our best, but that was not enough, they wanted us to try harder,
to go above our limits. Some of us quit in the end, but most of us continued
to love the sport. After the honeymoon period, getting used to the hectic
schedule, everything was much easier to handle. I started to become wiser
in my time management, choosing to do work in the mornings when I reach
school instead of playing on my phone. Before we go to training, I would
also do some homework on the bus or while waiting for the bus, so that
I would not have to cram at night. This allowed me to get enough sleep
almost every day, as well as time to relax and play games with my friends.
My solution worked for the most part, however, occasionally I would still
hand in my work late and get scolded by my teachers.</p>
<p>My experience in Canoeing has been an overall positive experience. The
seniors at the beginning of my journey helped me to get out of my comfort
zone. It instilled discipline and a good work ethic in me, teaching me
to not be lazy and to always strive for better. This was the first sports
CCA that I did not lose motivation to get better even after a long time.
Moreover, this CCA has also allowed me to forge friendships that I treasure
to this day. Going through ups and downs together with my teammates strengthened
my friendship with them, especially while doing crew-boats together. Coming
to training and paddling together in one boat, setting PRs together, and
improving together, was one of my fondest memories in this sport. My favorite
memory during my time in canoeing was going to NSG (National School Games)
with my partner, and both of us being able to achieve 3rd place in an event
that we did not train much for. Getting 2nd place in dragon boat with 10
of my other teammates is another memory that I will treasure. Before training
the members in my boat would all go and eat lunch together, hang out at
Kallang wave mall, and have an amazing time.</p>
<p>We also had amazing coaches to guide us on our way. The coaches would
set an example for all of us to follow, and would always expect the best
from us. They would steer us in the right direction if we were doing anything
wrong, and encourage us when we do something right. They are usually very
nice to us, always smiling and joking with us before training, but get
serious during training. When we do something that they repeatedly told
us not to do, they would reprimand us, re-enforcing the level that they
expect us to perform at. This way, we would not get used to being spoon-fed
what to do, becoming independent and more efficient.</p>
<p>My time in the canoeing CCA was something that I will not forget for a
long time. The experiences and values that I have taken from this CCA are
invaluable. I would have never thought that joining canoeing would have
given me so much, but between the sport, the coaches, the teachers, the
friends, the self-improvement, and the adventures that I have experienced,
I could not have asked for more from a CCA.</p>

<h4>Nigel Seah (1.01 – 2019)</h4>
<p>When I was in primary school, I took up many sport CCA like badminton,
soccer, etc. I first learned about this sport around 2015. I was enrolled
in a small canoeing club called KIAK where they let small kids like me
when I was young to try out this sport. I was really interested and enjoyed
canoeing.</p>
<p>When I reached secondary school, I got better and better. I managed to
DSA into ACS(I) through canoeing and became part of the school team. When
I first joined, I realized that there were a lot of other talented people
that also had an interest in canoeing. Not long after, I got used to the
new environment there and even made lots of friends. We all even had lunch
together even now and then. Other than some tough training here and there,
I had a time of my life.</p>
<p>Managing schoolwork and training was also very hard as I had barely any
free time. To overcome that, I planned out a schedule every week when to
do what so that I could keep up with both training and schoolwork. Also
whenever I had any free time like during recess and taking the bus, I would
start finishing up my work.</p>
<p>I think canoeing had benefitted me greatly, despite those tough training,
when I am paddling on the water, it helps me relaxed and not think about
schoolwork or examinations. It also keeps me fit and healthy and allowed
me to make lots of friends. Overall, I really enjoy canoeing and hope I
can complete in the nationals one day.</p>

<h4>Marcus Toh (2.11 – 2019)</h4>
<p>I’m Marcus Toh from 2.11. In primary school, I was in football CCA which
generally made my fitness level around average. However, I was not committed
to the sport as I found the drills grueling and demanding, thus I often
skipped training to laze around at home and play with console games.</p>
<p>I remember on the day of sports bazaar, I actually missed the canoeing
tryouts but during the CCA selection date, I realized that one of my close
friends was joining canoeing, and thus made a rash decision to join canoeing
to follow my friend, have fun while having the mindset that I could always
drop out of it if I didn’t like it.</p>
<p>Canoeing is a taxing sport as there are 4 training sessions a week. Most
of the time, I would come home lethargic. However, through this, canoeing
has actually improved me as a person as it cultivated the routine of finishing
the important things first and not procrastinate.</p>
<p>What draws me to the sport canoeing is that mostly everyone starts at
the same level in secondary school, as there isn’t a Canoeing CCA in Primary
schools, thus giving us an opportunity to win if we put in the hard work.
<br>I undoubtedly learned many core values from the Canoeing experience in
ACS(I) such as Time Management when juggling rest and homework, Excellence
when putting in hard work and Team Work when pushing with other CCA members
to the limit.</p>

<h4>Glenn Ho (1.03 – 2018)</h4>
<p>I’m Glenn Ho from 1.03 and I was from ACS(J). To get exposed to more sports
in primary school, I had many different CCA’s, such as Golf, Table Tennis
and Tennis. Hence, it was all purely recreational. My fitness was below
average and I was not thinking of joining a sport at the start of secondary
school. I even had the idea of joining chess club as I had been playing
chess with my classmates after the PSLE examination in school and had become
totally engrossed in playing it.</p>
<p>However, during the sports bazaar on the third day of school, the seniors
in Canoeing let me try out a Kayaking simulator and showed us a video to
get an idea of what Canoeing was about. After the sports bazaar, I had
a sudden interest to take up Canoeing as my CCA and I even felt that there
was a chance for me to win something as I realised that everyone started
Canoeing at the same age as you. I figured that Canoeing was actually a
vigourous and demanding sport that required a lot of fitness and strength.
Being chubby and although knowing that my fitness was below average, I
knew that if I worked hard in canoeing I would start seeing improvements
in my fitness.</p>
<p>The trainings are 4 times a week and so, for the first half of the year
I had trouble keeping up with my peers in my studies as I did not know
how to manage my time properly. However, Canoeing taught me how to manage
my time better and although the trainings were time consuming, I managed
to do all my homework and revise what I had learnt throughout the day when
I got back home after training and this helped me cut down on the time
spent playing computer games, as I realised that time was very precious.
Trainings would usually stand down 1 month before the mid year and final
year exams. I would usually make use of this time and go study with my
friends at the library or at the benches in the IB block. This has helped
me cope better in my studies.</p>
<p>Overall, Canoeing has made me more fit, helped me gain new friends, and
has taught me to have better time management.</p>

<h4>Seah Cohen (1.05 – 2018)</h4>
<p>I was quite fit in my primary school days and I enjoyed doing sports such
as badminton, swimming and running. I really gave my best in all sorts
of physical activities mainly because I like them.</p>
<p>I got to know about kayaking in 2015 when I was enrolled in a course called
Kids-In-A-Kayak (KIAK). Basically, KIAK program allows children of primary
school age to experience the fun of kayaking and develop an interest in
the sports under the guidance of dedicated coaches. I got hooked to the
sports on my first trial and have not looked back since then. But little
did I know I would be so involved in it today.</p>
<p>Every Sunday at 3 pm sharp, I would be at MacRitchie paddling. The trainings
became tougher as weeks go by, as our coaches were more demanding as we
got better at it. But I did not mind. This was mainly because I enjoyed
paddling with my KIAK mates. Soon we were asked to participate in inter-school
competitions. The adrenaline rush from winning made me more addicted to
the sports. And soon, I was looking forward to the trainings and competition.</p>
<p>I am now a proud member of the ACSI kayaking team. As KIAK was more of
a casual sport, it was tough training with the ACSI team in the early days,
having to keep in pace with the rest of them.</p>
<p>The trainings got more serious and tougher as the inter-school competition
drew near. We were going long distances and doing sprints almost every
session. However, what pulled me though all these tough trainings were
the encouragement from my fellow team mates. All of us endured through
the drilling and demanding trainings together, helping each other along
the way. Another really important lesson learnt was having the right mindset
to push you ahead. The is no point dragging yourself to training every
day if you do not truly enjoy the sports.</p>
<p>Studies! It was tough going for training almost every day and keeping
up with your school work. I was struggling during my first semester. But
soon I learnt to discipline myself and organise my time around my hectic
training schedule. That helped, and my grades improved.</p>
<p>I have benefitted much from my canoeing experience over the last year.
I have forged good friendship, built up my resilience and learnt how to
work around my challenges. One things I liked most about canoeing is how
the sports has bonded me and my friends. I have so many great times with
them during and outside of training. They are the ones that will spur you
on, help you improve, and be there when you need them.</p>
<p>For those reading this, give it a go at kayaking. You will never know
if you liked the sports until you give it a try.</p>

<h4>Gavyn Oh (1.08 – 2018)</h4>
<p>In primary school, my CCA was not a sports CCA so the only form of exercise
I got was from PE lessons and playing soccer with my friends. As a result,
I was not very fit.</p>
<p>When I first saw Canoeing, I thought it would be a fun thing to try out.
Canoeing was not a CCA available in primary school, so I guess I was drawn
to try a new experience. During the Sports Bazaar (Orientation Camp) I
was a bit tired from all the previous stations. When I reached the Canoeing
station, I decided to try out, cause why not? I was genuinely surprised
when they asked me to join and gave me the consent form.</p>
<p>I managed my time by doing homework whenever I had some free time instead
of playing games. In addition, the weeks before exams when CCA stood down
provided more than enough time for me to study. I benefitted immensely
from Canoeing. I definitely got stronger physically, as I went from doing
0 pull-ups to 10 in under a year. In addition, I made many new friends
and met many new people</p>

<h4>Kendrick Ang (1.09 – 2018)</h4>
<p>I’m Kendrick Ang from class 1.09 and I was originally in ACS(P). In my
primary school, I took up football as my CCA. However, since I was not
committed to the sport and often did not attend the sessions, my level
of fitness and skill was poor compared to my teammates.</p>
<p>During the first week of school in ACS(I), I got to try out Canoeing and
many other sports. When I tried Canoeing for the first time, it piqued
my interest and realised that it would be a good opportunity for me to
improve on my fitness and try out something new. At first, I joined Shooting
as I found it interesting with Canoeing only as my second option. However,
after a week of training, I realised that it was not the right sport for
me and decided to seek out Mr Jeffrey Tan, the teacher-in-charge, to request
to change my CCA to Canoeing.</p>
<p>Compared to CCAs in primary school, Canoeing has trainings 4 times a week.
This means that I would have less time to complete my school homework.
To ensure that I am able to finish my homework by the deadlines and keep
up with the curriculum, I set up a schedule to catch up on all my homework
after trainings at night or during days where there is no training.</p>
<p>Overall, from all the trainings I have had, I have learnt the importance
of perseverance, teamwork and responsibility. It is easier to get through
trainings if I form a sense of camaraderie with my teammates and encourage
each other to do our best. I have learnt many important values and life
skills from Canoeing and I will continue training hard.</p>

<h4>Justin Lee (1.11 – 2017)</h4>
<p>Before I joined canoeing I was not very sporty with swimming being the
only sport I had ever done. Even so, I had stopped swimming lessons a long
time ago and therefore had minimal exercise.</p>
<p>When I first joined ACS(I) I decided that I would try out a sport instead
of a club and society for my CCA as it would be a new experience. As canoeing
was the only sports CCA without any trials, it was the only sport that
would accept me.</p>
<p>I managed to balance my training and studies by listening attentively
in class and by good time management. I would often do my homework in any
pockets of time I have like the time in between periods. I also spent the
6 weeks breaks wisely often staying in the library after school.</p>
<p>Overall I think canoeing helped develop my fitness and help me to manage
my time better.</p>

<h4>Daniel Boh (2.05 – 2017)</h4>
<p>I used to be overweight in primary school. I joined Canoeing to try a
sport and to become fitter. Many Canoeist welcomed me to join as I was
tall and told me that I had much potential.</p>
<p>While in the CCA I would spend 45mins to 1hr after I got back from training
for revision and homework.</p>
<p>I have become fitter and healthier, and gained many new friends in the
process. I am very thankful for the support provided by the Canoeing teachers
and coaches.</p>

<h4>Fang Hao (2.05 – 2017)</h4>
<p>In primary school I was not very involved in sports as my CCA then was
robotics. I rarely did sports in primary school and the most I did was
attend PE. I was relatively unfit due to my low level of sports involvement
and I rarely played sports even during recess.</p>
<p>I wanted to join canoeing as I thought that it would be a fun, new and
interesting sport. I also wanted to do a sport in secondary school instead
of joining a CCA like robotics as I did not really find it particularly
fun or interesting CCA in primary school.</p>
<p>There was no selection process when I wanted to join canoeing, there was
simply just an introduction to canoeing before they allowed everyone that
wanted to join to sign up. There were no special qualifications that were
needed for me to join canoeing.</p>
<p>Training was not very invasive in terms of study time as there was always
a two week break before every major exam. Besides that time management
is also quite important as sometimes 2 weeks may not be enough to prepare
for exams.</p>
<p>I have benefited from canoeing in many ways. For example, after joining
canoeing I became much fitter as well as stronger. I also met many friends
in my time in canoeing from those in my year as well as seniors from older
years.</p>

<h4>Lucas Teo (2.12 – 2017)</h4>
<p>I was from ACS(P), and most of my time there was spent doing badminton.
I made it into the school team, though I was considered one of the less
valued player in the team. I got to play some games, and it was fun, but
I had no true satisfaction, because most of the time, whatever achievements
I got were from others hard work. Trophies were given out on a team basis,
and even though I lost many matches, I still got trophies when my friends
won theirs.</p>
<p>I wasn’t very motivated to improve myself, didn’t look forward to every
training, and didn’t give my best or push myself as hard as I could. Going
for training was more of a routine, and getting to my friends levels seemed
almost impossible.</p>
<p>Coming to secondary school, I decided to join Canoeing, because I thought
it was very interesting, and was inspired by my brother, who was previously
in the sport. I remember seeing him paddle and I was instantly captivated.
Canoeing also seemed like an opportunity for me to have a chance at winning,
because everyone started at the same age. This hope of winning was what
kept me going, and made me try to do my best.</p>
<p>Applying for the sport was very easy, and there were no selection trials
at all. All I needed to do was to express my interest in the sport, and
by the end of the discovery camp, I was notified that I had been accepted
into the sport.</p>
<p>When I first started secondary school, I was rather bad at time management,
and often did not pay attention in class, thinking that I could always
go back home to find out what the teacher had been talking about in school.
My mindset changed however, when the number of trainings increased. I came
back late on several days, and only had enough time to finish my homework,
and sometimes a bit more. This forced me to listen in class more attentively,
and to do more consistent work rather than trying to cram all the information
the night before the exams. I then realized, that my study method had been
wrong this whole time, and started to see that studies weren’t supposed
to take up so much of your time at home.</p>
<p>This realization let me to do more efficient learning, and allowed me
to have more time to do other things when there were no trainings. This
part of efficient learning, I feel, is one thing that I brought home from
canoeing so far.</p>
<p>Another thing that canoeing has taught me was to strive for what I wanted.
In primary school, I did many things such as studying because I was forced
to, and had no other choice. However, one thing about canoeing changed
my attitude. Many canoeing trainings such as to going to the gym were optional,
and this unique part of canoeing made me see the importance of your attitude,
which influences your drive and ultimately, success. The voluntary aspect
of canoeing also taught me to treasure my time, and emphasized to me the
relevance of the phrase “quality over quantity”.</p>

<h4>Aaron Tan (3.03 – 2017)</h4>
<p>I am Aaron from 3.03. I came from Anglo Chinese School (junior), where
I played football for school. I wouldn’t say I was fit but as a footballer
I ran quite a bit so I wasn’t too unfit either. However, despite my sports
background, I did not have fantastic eating habits and I was not satisfied
with my chubby physique.</p>
<p>In secondary school, I could have chosen between football and exploring
a new CCA. I chose the latter, of course. Canoeing appealed to me as it
was something completely different, seemed fun and the canoeing seniors
assured that we would acquire a high level of fitness. I was a little hesitant
at first as I did not know anything about the sport and I was worried that
the nature of the sport would stunt my already vertically challenged frame.
Managing between 2 CCAs and studies was another worry. Nevertheless, I
chose Canoeing; which has been one of the best decisions of my life.</p>
<p>Coping academically while training 4 times a week has been tough. There
have been times where I come home from training too exhausted to lift a
pen. That has improved, though. Over the past years, canoeing has instilled
a strong sense of discipline and time management in me, allowing me to
balance both my sporting and academic life well. Besides becoming fitter,
taller and developing my character, canoeing has also helped me build strong
friendships with my peers whom I have spent countless of hours with. Sure,
there have been ups and downs throughout this 3 years of my secondary school
life. But at the end of the day, canoeing has been a fruitful and life
changing experience for me.</p>

<h4>Anthony Goh (3.08 – 2017)</h4>
<p>During my primary school days, I never managed to stick to a particular
CCA, much less a sports CCA. In total, I joined 4 different CCA’s, only
one of which was a sports CCA. However, it was purely recreational. I was
below average in all aspects when it came to sports, and physical activities
were unappealing to me.</p>
<p>By secondary school, I knew that I wanted to join a sports CCA to become
more physically fit. I went forth with the encouragement of my parents,
taking part in all the CCA trials available and unfortunately failing spectacularly
at all of them. Canoeing was the only sports CCA that willingly accepted
me. Another reason it appealed to me was that it was new and exciting.
Those around me and those that I competed against would have just as much
experience as me. This even footing made it ideal for someone who had wasted
6 years of their CCAs, like me.</p>
<p>There were no real test or trials for anyone to join Canoeing. As a competitive
CCA, Canoeing stood out because of that. We were all given a chance to
try out the ergometers, kayaking simulators, and were introduced to the
various equipment we would be using. The only necessity to join was interest
in the CCA, and willingness to commit. Following the Sports Bazaar, I was
told that I was accepted into the CCA.</p>
<p>Managing my studies took a lot of discipline. Initially, I fell behind
in studies, as I often procrastinated or ignored assignments after my training.
In time, I learnt to follow a stricter routine, and put aside my hobbies
in favour of studying. I also began to appreciate free time more. Often,
before the start of school or during breaks between lessons I would study
or train. This efficient use of time enabled me to maintain good standards
in both CCA and academics.</p>
<p>Canoeing has changed my life radically and benefitted me in many ways.
I am much more physically fit, and have of course learned to manage my
time well. Furthermore, I have made many friends in the team. Through our
years of training together, we have forged strong bonds and relationships,
and there is an undeniable camaraderie amongst the team. Canoeing has also
developed me as a leader, from the many opportunities during training.
When the year 4 express cohort left, many of the responsibilities fell
to the year 3’s. We quickly learnt how to lead the team, under the guidance
and teaching of our seniors.</p>

<h4>Brian Ng (3.08 – 2017)</h4>
<p>I came from South View Primary School and was from the CCA Scouts. It
was nice CCA with many cool activities but hardly any fitness programmes
nor did I do any myself. Thus, I was very skinny and small sized compared
to my peers in primary school.</p>
<p>As I entered into ACS(I), I was quite clear that I wanted to join a sports
CCA to maintain a good fitness lifestyle as I was not satisfied with my
skinny body frame. However, I did not know that for most of the sports
CCA in this school, I need to pass a trial in order to get in. Thus, I
didn’t have much confidence in myself that I would pass the trials but
just when I was about to surrender my idea of joining a sports CCA, Canoeing
offered me a opportunity. A senior approached me and told me that Canoeing
did not require a trial nor any requirements to join but only needed a
willing heart. Therefore, I made the decision to join this CCA during the
sports bazaar.</p>
<p>Initially, training was very tiring and rigorous, and I often harboured
thoughts about quitting the CCA due to my exhaustion. I struggled with
my studies at first at the start of Year 1 but soon after I learned about
proper time management and self-discipline, with help and support from
both my seniors and teammates, my grades slowly improved again. This CCA
has also taught me how to be resilient and never give up in whatever I
do during the training sets that we often go through. In Canoeing, I have
formed countless close relationships with my fellow teammates. The community
in this CCA has been very encouraging and supportive to one another, always
helping each other in every situation!!</p>
<p>With this, Canoeing has been a very unique and special CCA to me, not
only has it given me a new experience but also it has also imparted with
many countless values that I would keep with me no matter where I go.</p>

<h4>Wong Jun Xiang (3.10 – 2017)</h4>
<p>Over my past 3 years as an ACSian, Canoeing has been a fruitful experience
for me. It has helped me develop physically and mentally into a healthier,
stronger person. During my primary school days, I was not heavily involved
in sports. I did not participate in any sporting CCAs, performed average
in my NAPFA test and did not enjoy exercising. My family had to drag me
out of the house just to go running and my fitness was poor. However, in
secondary school, I decided to change my life and try something different,
so I took a chance and joined Canoeing. As it provided me with an opportunity
to start from scratch on the same level as everyone else, I did not have
to fear falling behind right at the start. Canoeing would also allow me
to improve my fitness and live a healthier life. The selection process
was not complicated at all, only requiring me to express my interest in
the CCA. Without any selection trials to pass, this CCA gives an opportunity
to anyone who is willing and passionate to improve to participate, regardless
of their current physical fitness.</p>
<p>As I progressed through my 3 years in ACS(I), it became harder to manage
my many responsibilities, as I was participating in Canoeing alongside
the Malay Special Programme and Regional Studies Programme. I also had
to participate actively in my Uniformed Group, NCDCC, and still focus on
doing well in my studies. However, by managing my time well and learning
to cope with the stress that I faced, I was able to strike a good balance
between my studies and CCAs. I ensured that I treated my CCAs and studies
with equal importance and worked equally hard in both. As a result, I performed
extremely well academically, placing within the top few positions in the
level for 2 years. I even managed to successfully join the Integrated Programme
in Year 3, qualifying for the Accelerated Class of Science. Although the
transition from Express to IP and the more difficult content covered in
the Accelerated Class of Science, alongside the higher expectations of
the teachers, placed even more stress on me, I was able to manage my time
and did fairly well in both CCAs and studies.</p>
<p>From my Canoeing experience, I learnt how to plan my time and deal with
stress in order to balance my many commitments. Canoeing has also helped
me improve my health and fitness greatly, changing my lifestyle for the
better. In addition, I have made many good friends in this CCA, including
my seniors and juniors as well as those in my level. Lastly and most importantly,
I have learnt to persevere and never give up throughout the challenges
I face, working hard to improve constantly and achieve my goals. I am grateful
to have been given the opportunity to take part in this CCA and improve
myself while contributing back to the school.</p>

<h4>Wei Yan (3.11 – 2017)</h4>
<p>When I was in primary school, I was never athletic or fit in any way.
I was not interested in exercising or doing any forms of sports seriously.
At most, I would just do some recreational swimming or football. As for
NAPFA tests, I was below average and pretty weak at that time.</p>
<p>I wanted to join Canoeing as I wanted to change my lifestyle and become
more fit and healthy. Moreover, Canoeing is a sport that is unique and
cannot really be carried out elsewhere. Canoeing also seemed fun and an
interesting way for me to grow stronger and fitter. Additionally, Canoeing
was one of the few competitive sports that did not require the year 1s
to have any sports background or high fitness levels.</p>
<p>During the orientation, the Canoeing seniors asked me to try out the Canoeing
Ergo machines and they also told me that I had potential in this sport.
Additionally, I gave a high interest level which helped me to get selected.</p>
<p>Managing my studies and training was quite difficult for me, especially
in year 2 as the training became a lot more serious and tough due to the
canoeing season. In year 3, I managed to get a hang of it and managed them
was much easier. Firstly, this required discipline. I had to reduce the
time spent on leisurely activities such as gaming in order to finish all
my work and get enough sleep as well. Secondly, I try to finish some work
in school during free periods and recess. Thirdly, I try my best not to
procrastinate and finish my work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have benefited a lot from Canoeing. Not only has it physically transformed
me, but it has also given me a different mindset towards health and fitness.
I am no longer lazy to exercise and I prioritise my health and fitness
over most things. Also I managed to lose a lot of weight and gain even
more muscle mass. I have become a lot stronger and faster. Moreover, Canoeing
has made my stamina better and I am able to endure through more pain, pushing
my hardest every training. Canoeing has also made me more disciplined and
helped me manage my time better. Furthermore, Canoeing gave me ample leadership
opportunities that I would not have gotten if I were in other CCAs. This
allowed me to improve my leadership skills and improve my communication
with others, especially my teammates.</p>

<h4>Gregory Wong (3.13 – 2017)**</h4>
<p>I’m Gregory from 3.13. I was from Rosyth Primary School and had many CCAs
in my 6 years, including Badminton, Debate and Wushu. However, I rarely
participated in sports, apart from during Physical Education. Thus, I was
quite unfit and often did not do well in my NAPFA test, much to my disappointment.</p>
<p>When I enrolled in ACSI in Secondary 1, I was unsure of which CCA to join
as I knew this would be a 4-year commitment. However, I knew that I wanted
to be in a sports CCA in order to change my lifestyle into a healthier
one. After much consideration, I decided that Canoeing would be the best
choice as not only did everyone begin with little Canoeing experience,
it also seemed interesting as it was not a common sport. During the Sports
Bazaar, I expressed my interest and was thus selected by the teacher-in-charge.</p>
<p>Soon, training became up to 4 times a week and it was strenuous at first.
However, after the first few weeks, with consultation from my seniors,
I began to learn how to manage to time better. I would return home from
training and after dinner, I would discipline myself to begin work so as
to complete it early and rest for the day.</p>
<p>Canoeing has definitely benefited me in my secondary school experience.
It allowed me to push beyond what I thought I could and attain a fitness
standard that I could only dream of in primary school – requiring 13 minutes
to complete 1.6km but now being able to complete 2.4km in 9 minutes. It
also taught me many life skills such as time management, discipline, determination
and perseverance.</p>

<h4>Nicholas Cheok (3.16 – 2017)</h4>
<p>Hi, I am Nicholas Cheok from Class 3.16.</p>
<p>Back in primary school, my level was fitness was extremely low and could
barely do push ups, sit ups nor run. In fact, I was not really involved
in sports in primary school. Apart from PE lessons, I did not do any other
physical activity as I was in math and science club. Thus, I was extremely
unfit, to the point in which I struggled to pass napfa.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was in a club/ society in primary school, I decided to join
a sports CCA in secondary school as I wanted exposure to sports. Although
I was rejected by all the sports CCAs, our coach decided to give me a chance
and took me under his wing. Despite our small physique compared to the
handpicked students from the other schools, he did not give up on us. In
fact, he dedicated his time and effort into nurturing me into the paddler
and person I am today. I was extremely grateful to be given the opportunity
and joined canoeing.</p>
<p>Soon, training schedule got increasingly more hectic, from twice a week
to four times a week. As I rarely attended any CCA trainings in primary
school, It was extremely tough to manage my studies and canoeing at first.
Nevertheless, I persevered. I would religiously do revision so as to reinforce
what was taught that day. This helped to lighten the workload during exams.
During canoeing season, I would focus more on canoeing, placing a slightly
lighter emphasis on studies and vice versa during exam period. Additionally,
the seniors would tutor the juniors, forming a stronger bond amongst the
team.</p>
<p>Canoeing has benefitted me greatly, from improving my fitness to improving
my time management. Besides that, canoeing has also allowed me to forge
closer bonds with my teammates as during the tough trainings, we would
spur each other on. Through all this I learnt the importance of teamwork,
diligence and perseverance.</p>

<h4>Tan Yi Hong (4.15 – 2017)</h4>
<p>In primary school I was often active on sports and participated in both
the tennis and swimming CCA’s. For swimming I went twice a week and was
at level 8 of training, the highest levels being falcon, development and
then level 8. As for tennis it was twice a week and I was in the school
team and participated in competitions from primary 2 to primary 5.</p>
<p>I wanted to join canoeing as I wanted to try out something new as I had
started to lose interest in tennis. I was also heavily influenced by my
brother to join canoeing, since I saw how dedicated he was to the sport
that he would ask me to help him train.</p>
<p>I was selected by the interest level that I had, and also the fact that
the coach recognized me since he would sometimes see me after training
waiting for my brother.</p>
<p>During training periods, most of the homework I had was done in school
during the switching of lessons or free time. The 1 month break that we
have before exams was enough to finish revision of all my subjects as well.
Self-training was usually just static exercises that could be done in my
room, and in PE I usually pushed harder than what was required when we
were doing physical fitness training.</p>
<p>From canoeing I have learnt many things, the most important to me being
discipline learnt from training and the importance of hard work. Discipline
has helped me to manage my studies with training, making use of my free
time. Canoeing has showed me multiple times how hard work far surpasses
any talent and can not only be applied in the field of sports but studies
as well. However, the greatest benefit from canoeing is my important teammates
who I know will stick with me through thick and thin and is the reason
why I managed to stay in canoeing until today.</p>

<h4>Hup Jun Jie (5.01 – 2018)</h4>
<p>Before joining Canoeing, in my primary school I was not in a sport CCA
and even though I loved sports, I was not playing any sports at a competitive
level.</p>
<p>I thought it was interesting and I wanted to join a sport. I was selected
with no prerequisite.</p>
<p>Canoeing is a taxing sport. Very often I come back home from training
being very lethargic and very lazy. However, this has also taught me to
handle high workloads when I grew older and even though many people see
this as a problem, I would view this as a lesson to prepare us for the
future.</p>
<p>Canoeing has taught me many things, from values such as resilience, determination
to things such as lifelong friendship. Canoeing is a once in a lifetime
opportunity and I am very happy that I seized that opportunity.</p>

<h4>Sean Becker (6.11 – 2018)</h4>
<p>I joined rugby in primary 1 but I didn’t enjoy it very much so I quit
in primary 3. Then I was without a CCA for the rest of primary school.
At the very most I would do some light gym exercises to keep active but
honestly aside from natural fitness I wasn’t doing very much in terms of
exercise or any sort of sports.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by the sport on CCA day as I hadn’t heard about it before
but one of the seniors signed me up because I was bigger than the other
Sec 1s and on the day of the selection I just felt like trying something
new so I figured I would give it a try</p>
<p>It’s a tough time trying to manage all my work especially in IB when our
schedules don’t permit us much time outside of school. I thought it best
that I focus on completing as much work as possible during school hours
and then completely focusing on training after that. At night it was also
difficult to complete much work as I also needed sufficient sleep so I
had to prioritise whenever I faced a tough decision.</p>
<p>During exam periods I did my best to maintain a healthy balance between
these commitments even when races and examinations clashed. To do my best
in both would be a difficult task but that was no excuse not to do so.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that Canoeing has taught me the value of hard work.
I was never immediately the best but only through dedication and profound
belief did I progress to a much higher level than I ever thought possible.</p>
<p>It has also greatly and in a positive manner enhanced my confidence and
given me the tools I need to overcome any problem I encounter and welcome
adversity which I feel will help in the long run</p>

<h4>Ray Chua (6.15 – 2017)</h4>
<p>Never before have I regarded myself as a sportsman, having absolutely
no sporting background whatsoever in my primary school days. I was your
typical unfit primary school kid, struggling to pass his NAPFA tests, dreading
P.E lessons, or basically any activity that required a heightened level
of physical exertion. Despite this, much to my surprise, Canoeing took
me in during the Sports Bazaar, the programme in the Sec 1 Orientation
Camp which lets you try out most sports in the school. I admit, I was skeptical.
One of the most physically demanding sports in the school wanted me on
their team. I admit, I was afraid. The training schedule seemed intense,
and I feared that I could not handle the stress.</p>
<p>I was entering into completely unknown territory, a stark change from
the relaxed days of primary school. It was a frightening decision that
I had to make as a Sec 1 kid, and for awhile, I kept looking back and wondering
if it was indeed the right choice I made to join the team.</p>
<p>Six years down the road, as an alumni of this school and team, I can safely
say that it was the best decision that I had made in my life.</p>
<p>The culture in this team is unrivaled by any other, the sheer brotherhood
and camaraderie shared between our members creates strong bonds, bonds
that last an eternity. Whoever you were before in primary school, it doesn’t
matter, it never matters. We embrace all who show commitment and interest
with open arms. Here in this team, you are not short or tall or fat or
skinny, you are a canoeist, and you are given as equal as a chance as anyone
else to succeed.</p>
<p>Canoeing has imparted to me essential life skills. The competitive environment
that I was exposed to, has instilled in me the necessary perseverance and
fervour to push beyond my zone of comfort, and be better equipped to pursue
my goals. The intensity of the trainings, being 4 times a week, has taught
me self-discipline, allowing me to manage my time properly, an invaluable
skill given the stress of the IB programme. The physical training itself,
has allowed me to change who I am, making me fitter, stronger, healthier,
and boosting my self-confidence in this regard. Overall, Canoeing has played
an integral role in shaping who I am as a person, and really cannot imagine
a life without it.</p>
<p>I understand that for many, choosing a school and a CCA might be a tremendous
responsibility, especially for a 12 year old. I strongly urge you to consider
AC Canoeing and give it a chance. So many of us have before, and few have
ever regretted it.</p>
