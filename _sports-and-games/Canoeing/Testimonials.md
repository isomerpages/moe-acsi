####  Emmanuel Ku (1.08 – 2022)

I am Emmanuel Ku from class 1.08 (2022). When I was in ACS Primary, I joined rugby and swimming as my CCA. These 2 CCAs require a lot of training & time to be physically fit. The trainings had contributed to my high level of good physical health. However, after PSLE and also Covid over the last 2 years, most of my active activities stopped & I did not spend much time outdoors, thus I put on a lot of weight.

In 2022, after I entered ACSI, my parents wanted me to try something new. Additionally, some of my friends who are already in canoeing persuaded me to join canoeing. When the trials for canoeing began, I decided to participate as there was no harm trying. The coaches were friendly and helpful in teaching us the proper way to canoe and kayak. I followed their instructions during the trial, took some online quizzes & demonstrated some level of proficiency, I was overjoyed that I got selected for the canoeing CCA!

At first, when I joined canoeing, it was quite tough as I had to juggle between school work and 2 CCAs. Additionally, canoeing training is quite rigorous as the training takes up to 3 days of after school time a week. With the help and advices from my teachers and friends, they taught me how to manage my time wisely. My parents also kept reminding me about the importance of work life balance, and knowing the art of setting priorities.

There were many things which I have benefited from Canoeing CCA in the past year. I learned to not only work in team, but individually. Being new to canoeing from the start, I picked up a lot of new skills in managing the canoe and importantly how to maneuver it correctly & speedily. Last but not least, I learned too that perseverance, humility and unity are very important to allow me to keep learning with a positive attitude.

#### Matthew Loo (1.10 – 2022)

In my primary school, I had many sports CCAs, namely swimming, tennis and football. I focused on football and played for the school in National School Games (NSG). I was quite fit and did well in swim meets and sports days. However, due to the circuit breaker in 2020, I could not play football and did not exercise regularly, and thus my fitness level decreased.

A friend introduced me to a kayaking course called Kids-In-A-Kayak (KIAK), which allowed children to experience the joy of kayaking and for them to develop an interest in the sport. Sure enough, I enjoyed it and paddled every Sunday. The weekly paddling sessions allowed me to get better at the sport, while also allowing me to increase my fitness level. I enjoyed canoeing so much that I decided that I would take up canoeing as my CCA in secondary school.  
When I came to ACSI, I took up canoeing as my CCA. I trained 4 times a week, which took up most of my time. Thus, to manage my studies and my training, I had to manage my time well. By planning my weekly schedule every Saturday, I balanced out my training and my studies, thus allowing me to focus on both. I could keep up with all the work assigned, while also training hard.

During my training, I learnt many things from the coach, which helped me improve my technique, allowing me to become a better paddler. Not only did I improve in canoeing, but I also developed strong friendships amongst the canoeing team. In April I also had the chance to represent the school in (NSG). This gave me lots of experience in competing for the school and helped me to better enjoy racing.

I benefitted tremendously from Canoeing in ACSI. I got physically stronger, and my fitness level has increased due to the many training sessions. It has allowed me to better understand the importance of time management, which will be useful wherever I go, and I have forged strong friendships with my teammates who always encourage and support me, always helping me along the way. Canoeing has taught me many lessons and values as well, such as unity, resilience, unity and much more.

Overall, I enjoy canoeing, and the CCA has allowed me to become more fit, forge strong friendships, have better time management skills, and learn good values.

#### Tyler Tan (1.11 – 2022)

In primary school, I wasn’t super fit, or neither was I very strong. The CCA I took up was dance, and there was only training once a week, and besides that, I led a sedentary lifestyle and did not do much exercise at all. My fitness level was very low, and I was lethargic even during basic exercise.

During school orientation, we had to take part in the sports bazaar and tryout for the different sports CCAs. At that time, I was contemplating joining chess club, as I knew I would not do very well in a sports CCAs due to my fitness level. Then I stumbled upon canoeing. The sport was interesting and something that I had never heard of before. I was reluctant to go for the tryouts, but my mother convinced me to. I wanted to join canoeing as I knew that if I trained hard enough, my fitness would improve and I also wanted to join a sports CCA. Another reason is that some of my friends were joining canoeing as well.

During the tryouts, we went to MacRitchie reservoir and firstly, coach Ismail taught us how to use the boat and the names of its components. The next few sessions were comprised of just paddling around the bay and some races. The races were very fun and competitive. We also had to take a theory test to get selected. After a week or so, we were told that we were accepted into the CCA and I was quite ecstatic.

During the year, it was quite difficult to manage the training and my huge secondary school work load. When I transitioned to secondary school, I could already barely manage the incrementally huge amount of homework. On top of that, the canoeing training was three times a week. The largest struggle was coursework season when I had to juggle training and multiple calls. I found the solution to this issue was to have good time management. With good time management, I could go for training, have calls and even some rest time for myself to relax.

I have benefitted from the canoeing experience in multiple ways. I have become a bit more fit and I have also gained many precious friendships that I am going to treasure for a lifetime. Not only that, I have found something I can be passionate about and something that can make good use of my time instead of me lazing at home.

#### Evan Ching (1.12 – 2022)

Hello, I’m Evan Ching. I was from ACSJ before I joined ACSI. During my primary school days, my fitness level was only average. I used to be in many CCAs such as Table Tennis, Football and Chess. However, I never really enjoyed these CCAs because they did not give me the adrenaline as kayaking gives.

In 2016, I was introduced to kayaking by a neighbor. I joined a program called Kids-In-A-Kayak (KIAK) where primary school students are exposed to kayaking as the primary schools did not have kayaking as CCA. When I had my first trial for KIAK, I did not know that it would lead me this far. As we got better, the intensity of the trainings and the number of trainings increased. We were also participating in different types of competitions like sprints and marathons.

I entered ACSI through kayaking DSA. I wanted to stay in this sport as kayaking is very different from many other sports. This is because kayaking is water sport and we can paddle at MacRitchie Reservoir while many other people are not able to. I also like the intensity and competitiveness that comes with kayaking.

During the discovery camp, we were brought around the school by our seniors to try out different CCAs to see which one is best for us. I remember when we were brought to the Canoeing/Kayaking booth, we were allowed to try the equipment. I remember my classmates all having fun with the machines as they considered giving the CCA a chance.

When I started secondary school, I was training 4 to 5 times a week including KIAK. Thus, I had very little time to study. At first, I had a hard time trying to catch up with my peers in terms of my grades. However, after my seniors gave me good advice on time management, I was able to be on par with my classmates. I learn how to do a good study plan and schedule and I follow to it closely. Also, I have to spend less time gaming and devices as time is precious to me.

I have benefitted alot from Kayaking through the years. I have forged many good friendships, learnt the importance of perseverance and endurance. I also learnt to never give up during a race.

Overall, you should give this CCA a chance like how many of us did. Few have regretted it.

#### Nigel Seah (1.01 – 2019)

When I was in primary school, I took up many sport CCA like badminton, soccer, etc. I first learned about this sport around 2015. I was enrolled in a small canoeing club called KIAK where they let small kids like me when I was young to try out this sport. I was really interested and enjoyed canoeing.

When I reached secondary school, I got better and better. I managed to DSA into ACS(I) through canoeing and became part of the school team. When I first joined, I realized that there were a lot of other talented people that also had an interest in canoeing. Not long after, I got used to the new environment there and even made lots of friends. We all even had lunch together even now and then. Other than some tough training here and there, I had a time of my life.

Managing schoolwork and training was also very hard as I had barely any free time. To overcome that, I planned out a schedule every week when to do what so that I could keep up with both training and schoolwork. Also whenever I had any free time like during recess and taking the bus, I would start finishing up my work.

I think canoeing had benefitted me greatly, despite those tough training, when I am paddling on the water, it helps me relaxed and not think about schoolwork or examinations. It also keeps me fit and healthy and allowed me to make lots of friends. Overall, I really enjoy canoeing and hope I can complete in the nationals one day.

####  Glenn Ho (1.03 – 2018)

I’m Glenn Ho from 1.03 and I was from ACS(J). To get exposed to more sports in primary school, I had many different CCA’s, such as Golf, Table Tennis and Tennis. Hence, it was all purely recreational. My fitness was below average and I was not thinking of joining a sport at the start of secondary school. I even had the idea of joining chess club as I had been playing chess with my classmates after the PSLE examination in school and had become totally engrossed in playing it.

However, during the sports bazaar on the third day of school, the seniors in Canoeing let me try out a Kayaking simulator and showed us a video to get an idea of what Canoeing was about. After the sports bazaar, I had a sudden interest to take up Canoeing as my CCA and I even felt that there was a chance for me to win something as I realised that everyone started Canoeing at the same age as you. I figured that Canoeing was actually a vigourous and demanding sport that required a lot of fitness and strength. Being chubby and although knowing that my fitness was below average, I knew that if I worked hard in canoeing I would start seeing improvements in my fitness.

The trainings are 4 times a week and so, for the first half of the year I had trouble keeping up with my peers in my studies as I did not know how to manage my time properly. However, Canoeing taught me how to manage my time better and although the trainings were time consuming, I managed to do all my homework and revise what I had learnt throughout the day when I got back home after training and this helped me cut down on the time spent playing computer games, as I realised that time was very precious. Trainings would usually stand down 1 month before the mid year and final year exams. I would usually make use of this time and go study with my friends at the library or at the benches in the IB block. This has helped me cope better in my studies.

Overall, Canoeing has made me more fit, helped me gain new friends, and has taught me to have better time management.

#### Seah Cohen (1.05 – 2018)

I was quite fit in my primary school days and I enjoyed doing sports such as badminton, swimming and running. I really gave my best in all sorts of physical activities mainly because I like them.

I got to know about kayaking in 2015 when I was enrolled in a course called Kids-In-A-Kayak (KIAK). Basically, KIAK program allows children of primary school age to experience the fun of kayaking and develop an interest in the sports under the guidance of dedicated coaches. I got hooked to the sports on my first trial and have not looked back since then. But little did I know I would be so involved in it today.

Every Sunday at 3 pm sharp, I would be at MacRitchie paddling. The trainings became tougher as weeks go by, as our coaches were more demanding as we got better at it. But I did not mind. This was mainly because I enjoyed paddling with my KIAK mates. Soon we were asked to participate in inter-school competitions. The adrenaline rush from winning made me more addicted to the sports. And soon, I was looking forward to the trainings and competition.

I am now a proud member of the ACSI kayaking team. As KIAK was more of a casual sport, it was tough training with the ACSI team in the early days, having to keep in pace with the rest of them.

The trainings got more serious and tougher as the inter-school competition drew near. We were going long distances and doing sprints almost every session. However, what pulled me though all these tough trainings were the encouragement from my fellow team mates. All of us endured through the drilling and demanding trainings together, helping each other along the way. Another really important lesson learnt was having the right mindset to push you ahead. The is no point dragging yourself to training every day if you do not truly enjoy the sports.

Studies! It was tough going for training almost every day and keeping up with your school work. I was struggling during my first semester. But soon I learnt to discipline myself and organise my time around my hectic training schedule. That helped, and my grades improved.

I have benefitted much from my canoeing experience over the last year. I have forged good friendship, built up my resilience and learnt how to work around my challenges. One things I liked most about canoeing is how the sports has bonded me and my friends. I have so many great times with them during and outside of training. They are the ones that will spur you on, help you improve, and be there when you need them.

For those reading this, give it a go at kayaking. You will never know if you liked the sports until you give it a try.

#### Gavyn Oh (1.08 – 2018)

In primary school, my CCA was not a sports CCA so the only form of exercise I got was from PE lessons and playing soccer with my friends. As a result, I was not very fit.

When I first saw Canoeing, I thought it would be a fun thing to try out. Canoeing was not a CCA available in primary school, so I guess I was drawn to try a new experience. During the Sports Bazaar (Orientation Camp) I was a bit tired from all the previous stations. When I reached the Canoeing station, I decided to try out, cause why not? I was genuinely surprised when they asked me to join and gave me the consent form.

I managed my time by doing homework whenever I had some free time instead of playing games. In addition, the weeks before exams when CCA stood down provided more than enough time for me to study. I benefitted immensely from Canoeing. I definitely got stronger physically, as I went from doing 0 pull-ups to 10 in under a year. In addition, I made many new friends and met many new people
