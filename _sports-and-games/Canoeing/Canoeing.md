The ACS(I) Canoeing Team was formed in January 1998, with the aim of using sports as a platform to build students’ character through experiential learning. By February 1998, there were ten regular members, training with boats and paddles borrowed from the Anglo-Chinese Junior College Canoe Team and the SAFRA Canoe and Dragon Boat Team. The Dragon Boat arm of the Canoeing Team was started in June 2000, as a team building activity.

Today, the ACS(I) Canoeing Team trains using International–Class racing boats, and competes actively in the National Inter-Schools’ Canoeing Championships and the National Junior Canoeing Championships.

The ACS(I) Canoeing team offers students opportunities to achieve / develop the following:

*   Excellence in sports
*   Representation in Inter-School Games
*   Physical fitness and mental strength
*   Self-discipline
*   Leadership
