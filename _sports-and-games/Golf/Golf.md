Golf in ACS (Independent) is an exciting and challenging CCA. We welcome students who have a passion in learning the sport and wish to make friends with a common interest.

The school participates in National Golf Championship in A, B and C Divisions every year. The students in the competitive group can choose to either train under the golf professionals at the club or have their own training schedules to prepare them to participate in the National Championships. We encourage students with handicap 18 and below to go for try outs in order to participate in the National Golf Championship at the individual level.

Golf is also offered as a recreational sport in ACS (Independent). We encourage interested students to join the recreational group to hone their skills in the sport. Students must be PC in order to join the recreational group.

All students are required to bring to their own golf equipment for the training sessions and be in the attire required for the sport.
