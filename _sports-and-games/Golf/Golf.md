Golf is a really fun and challenging activity at our school. We'd love for students who enjoy the sport and want to make friends who share the same interests to join us.

Every year, our school takes part in the National School Games (NSG) Golf Championships in A, B, and C Divisions. If you're in the competitive group, you can choose to train with golf professionals at the club or follow your own training schedule to prepare for the Championships. We encourage students with a handicap of 15 and below to try out for a chance to participate individually in the NSG.

If you're into golf as a hobby, we have a recreational group too! Join us to improve your skills and have a good time. You can check with the teacher in charge via Microsoft Teams for more details.

Remember to bring your own golf equipment to training, and make sure to wear the right clothes for the sport. Let's have a great time playing golf together!
