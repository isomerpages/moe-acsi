<p>Squash 2024</p>
<p>2024 has been yet another remarkable year for ACS (Independent) Squash
as our ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division boys and our ‘A’ Division girls have retained
their momentous championship title for their second consecutive year. With
the ‘A’ girls defending their championship title, the squash team has done
it again, even in the face of formidable opponents, and retained their
‘Super Grand Slam’ title.</p>
<p>Our ‘B’ Division boys spearheaded the team’s path to victory, breezing
through the group stages before sealing a solid 5-0 win against Saint Andrews
Secondary School in the finals. The ‘A’ Division boys also powered through
their group stage matches before coming head to head against Anglo Chinese
Junior College in the finals. After a hard-fought battle, the ‘A’ boys
emerged victorious with a score of 4-1. The ‘A’ girls continued the winning
streak, topping the group stage matches before facing off against Raffles
Institution in the finals. In a spectacular display of tenacity, grit and
perseverance, the girls emerged triumphant in a heated five-setter with
a score of 3-2.</p>
<p>The ‘C’ division boys put a very strong and steady performance throughout
the season and remained undefeated against all the other schools in a new
double round robin format to clinch their 6th&nbsp;consecutive Championship
title. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This phenomenal achievement of retaining four Championship titles for
the second consecutive year is a testament to the many sacrifices and reflective
of the growth of the entire team. The teams thank God for being with us
as we fought to defend our championship titles. In addition, we would like
to thank Mr Arene Koh and the Senior Administration for taking the time
to spur us on at every final. We are also grateful to our teachers-in-charge,
Ms Mavis Hoon, Ms Shirley Lim, Mdm Cheng Siau Yian and Mr Jerel Chen for
their guidance and unwavering support, as well as our coach, Mr Victor
Koh for training the teams to excel to our truest potential.</p>
<p>We would also like to extend our heartfelt thanks to all the supporters
who cheered us on during our matches. To God be the glory, the Best is
Yet to Be!</p>

<p>It was an exhilarating moment in this year’s finals when fourth tie Benjamin
Koh (3.12) finally sealed the Championship point for ACS in a 5 set win
over Fairfield’s Gabriel Chow. Victory was indeed hard fought and earned
after a 2 – 1 lead over Fairfield after Edward Thng (3.13) and Samuel Lau
(3.16) defeated their opponents. Facing Fairfield’s top seed, Daven Wong,
Kan Weng Yean (4.16) gave his all but failed to gain a victory in a very
close 5 sets upset in the second tie. Nevertheless, victory was exceptionally
sweet for the team after Benjamin won and leaving fifth tie, Joshua Lim
(4.14) to wrap up the Nationals Squash finals with a 4 – 1 win over Fairfield
to reclaim the B Division boys Championship title.</p>
<p>Leading to the finals, the team has done exceedingly well in the preliminary
matches beating Outram, St Andrews and NJC 5 – 0 respectively. In the semi-finals
match up against RI, Samuel Lau (3.16) upset RI’s top seed Josiah Chong
3 – 2, which is a major morale booster for the team who later beat RI 4
– 1 to seal their position in the finals.</p>
<p>The B Division Squash boys would like to thank all their teachers and
coach for their guidance, support and encouragement through this intensive
journey and most of all, to thank our Almighty Father for His protection
and blessings over the team.</p>
<p>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
