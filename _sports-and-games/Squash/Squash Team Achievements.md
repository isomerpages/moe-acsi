**B Division Squash Boys reclaim Nationals Schools Squash Championship Title 2019**

![](/images/B-Division-Squash-Team-2019-1350x1013.jpg)

It was an exhilarating moment in this year’s finals when fourth tie Benjamin Koh (3.12) finally sealed the Championship point for ACS in a 5 set win over Fairfield’s Gabriel Chow. Victory was indeed hard fought and earned after a 2 – 1 lead over Fairfield after Edward Thng (3.13) and Samuel Lau (3.16) defeated their opponents. Facing Fairfield’s top seed, Daven Wong, Kan Weng Yean (4.16) gave his all but failed to gain a victory in a very close 5 sets upset in the second tie. Nevertheless, victory was exceptionally sweet for the team after Benjamin won and leaving fifth tie, Joshua Lim (4.14) to wrap up the Nationals Squash finals with a 4 – 1 win over Fairfield to reclaim the B Division boys Championship title.

Leading to the finals, the team has done exceedingly well in the preliminary matches beating Outram, St Andrews and NJC 5 – 0 respectively. In the semi-finals match up against RI, Samuel Lau (3.16) upset RI’s top seed Josiah Chong 3 – 2, which is a major morale booster for the team who later beat RI 4 – 1 to seal their position in the finals.

The B Division Squash boys would like to thank all their teachers and coach for their guidance, support and encouragement through this intensive journey and most of all, to thank our Almighty Father for His protection and blessings over the team.

To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!
