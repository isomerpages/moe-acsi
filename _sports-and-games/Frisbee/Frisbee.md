Ultimate Frisbee is a team sport where 7 players try to catch a disk in the end zone, like rugby. The non-contact sport, played in Singapore for schools is a mixed event usually played with 4 boys and 3 girls at a time. It is also a self-refereeing sport where the players call, and contest, fouls, based on rules and “spirit of the game”. “Spirit of the game” is concept based on integrity and honour.

Frisbee was introduced to ACS (Independent) as a CCA in 2012 and is currently open to Years 5 & 6 students only.
