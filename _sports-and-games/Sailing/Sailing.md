**Welcome to our ACS (Independent) Sailing family!**

This is truly a sport that we can boast of our home-grown talents, born and bred in Singapore. With a strong backing of our school, dedicated teachers, coaches and supportive parents, it is definitely a platform for sailors to excel further.

**Colin Cheng:** After enrolling in ACS in 2002, he has moved on to be known as the best Asian sailor in one of the most competitive classes – the single-handed men’s laser standard. In the London summer Olympics in 2012, he had scored the best result an Asian country had seen in the Olympics in Laser standard, 13th position. In the Laser World Championships in Mexico, he was ranked 26th amongst the 112 best laser sailors in the world. He also participated in the Rio Olympic games along with 10 other Singaporean sailors, finishing in 20th place.

**Matthew Scott Lau:** Entered the school in 2011. He had shown remarkable progress in the double-handed 420 class, eventually achieving a silver medal in the 2015 SEA games

**Jackson Ho, Terrence Koh:** Currently coaching

In order to carry on this legacy of achievements and our commitment to the sport, the sailing recreational arm was set up to discover new talents for the sport. Students who are interested can join the CCA either in Year 1 or Year 5 to be equipped with basic sailing skills. I am proud to say that some of these amateur sailors have caught on and represented schools in the annual interschool championship.
