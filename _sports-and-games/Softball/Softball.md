The Anglo-Chinese School Squad was first formed in 2000 with one team of eager Secondary One students ably led by then teacher-in-charge Mrs Yoon Lay Beng. The squad has expanded to consist of three teams in Division ‘A’ Boys (Years 5 and 6), Division ‘B’ Boys (Years 3 and 4), and Division ‘C’ Boys (Years 1 and 2). Mdm Clarice Tan is now the overall teacher-in-charge and is joined by Mr Brian Chirnside, Mr Bobby Chew, Mdm You Lixia, Ms Quek Siew Ling, and Mdm Vanessa Seah.

All three teams are involved in the National Inter-School competitions and train regularly under the expert guide of the several coaches. The school is also an active participant at the Singapore Recreation Club’s Annual Softball Carnival.

In 2024, there is a new combined team between ACS(I) and ACJC for the A Division Girls and Boys Team respectively.

Training occurs in school usually on the Artificial Turf, where a softball diamond has been painted out at a corner, near the squash courts. There is ample equipment that allows the players to practice and improve themselves during training sessions. With the inclusion of over 10 different bats, a couple of softball pitching machines, practice nets, and bases, there is a variety of available equipment that ensures an all-rounded performance training of the players.
