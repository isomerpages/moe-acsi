The Anglo-Chinese School Squad was first formed in 2000 with one team of eager Secondary One students ably led by then teacher-in-charge Mrs Yoon Lay Beng. The squad has expanded to consist of three teams in Division ‘A’ Boys (Years 5 and 6), Division ‘B’ Boys (Years 3 and 4), and Division ‘C’ Boys (Years 1 and 2). Mdm Clarice Tan is now the overall teacher-in-charge and is joined by Mr Brian Chirnside, Mr Bobby Chew, Ms Quek Siew Ling, Mdm Vanessa Seah and Mdm Kwoh Siew Lay.
