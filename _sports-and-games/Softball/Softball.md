The Anglo-Chinese School Squad was first formed in 2000 with one team of eager Secondary One students ably led by then teacher-in-charge Mrs Yoon Lay Beng. The squad has expanded to consist of three teams in Division ‘A’ Boys (Years 5 and 6), Division ‘B’ Boys (Years 3 and 4), and Division ‘C’ Boys (Years 1 and 2). In 2024, we have also started a combined A Division team with Anglo-Chinese Junior College. Mdm Clarice Tan is now the overall teacher-in-charge and is joined by Mr Brian Chirnside, Ms Quek Siew Ling, Mdm Kwoh Siew Lay, Mdm Chong Choon Lee, and Mdm Eunice Koh.
