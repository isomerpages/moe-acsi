**Nationals**:

Every year, all the three divisions take part in the annual National Softball Competitions, whereby the school competes against the other schools in Singapore, through different group stages, semi-finals, and in the end, the finals. Many rival schools such as Raffles Institution and Catholic High School indulge in this series of matches. The winner is awarded the trophy of the year, alongside a challengers’ trophy.

**SRC (Singapore Recreation Club):**

This is a carnival held during the March holidays, where schools yet again come together to take part in matches to achieve the title of victory. The matches are usually held during the first and last weekends of the week. All the school gather to compete, and after getting through a few matches, they’d play in the finals to end the series.

**International Games:**

In recent years, our school has proceeded overseas during the November-December holidays to compete internationally against schools overseas. Places that have been visited include Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Hong Kong. This serves as a very good experience for the players, not only as an aspect of sports, but also in terms of culture.
