Floorball was introduced in 1994 and was officially recognized by PESEB and included in the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) Sports and Games Calender in January 2007. Today, it is a niche sport in a number of secondary schools in Singapore.

It is no surprise that floorball is fast gaining popularity –  it is a _**fun**_  and  **_exciting_**  sport played  **_indoors_** . Played in 3 periods of 15 minutes each (with 3 minutes break in between each period), it is very  **_fast- paced_** and exhilarating for the players as well as for the audience. Requiring only a plastic stick and a ball, it is a relatively safe sport and can be  **_picked up by anyone._**

The ACS (Independent) Floorball team is a relatively new team, having been created in 2009. If you have tried floorball before/have an interest in sports and would like to be a part of the team that makes history in ACS (Independent), we would encourage you to join us!
