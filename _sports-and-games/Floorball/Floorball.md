Floorball was introduced in 1994 and was officially recognized by PESEB and included in the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) Sports and Games Calendar in January 2007. Today, it is a niche sport in several secondary schools in Singapore.

It is no surprise that floorball is fast gaining popularity – it is a **_fun_** and _**exciting**_ sport played _**indoors**_ . Played in 3 periods of 15 minutes each (with 3 minutes break in between each period), it is very _**fast- paced**_ and exhilarating for the players as well as for the audience. Requiring only a plastic stick and a ball, it is a relatively safe sport and can be _**picked up by anyone.**_

The ACS (Independent) Floorball team is a relatively new team, having been created in 2009. If you have tried floorball before/have an interest in sports and would like to be a part of the team that makes history in ACS (Independent), we would encourage you to join us!
