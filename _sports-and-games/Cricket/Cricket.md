Cricket continues to be one of ACS (Independent)’s Pride for the past 80 years. Its history goes back to 1934 when Cricket was first introduced by Mr T.W Hinch, then the Principal of ACS. Mr Cecil Wong’s father, who represented Singapore in Cricket, was asked to be its first coach when it was started as an Extra Curricular Activity (now called CCA) in 1934. Since then, it has brought only pride and glory to ACS family.
