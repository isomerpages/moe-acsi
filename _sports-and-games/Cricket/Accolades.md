**Singapore Schools Sports Council – Sports Boy of the year 2017 – Cricket CCA**

**Ganesh Anirudh -6.12 Jericho**

Ganesh Anirudh has been named Sports boy of the Year 2017(Cricket CCA) by the Singapore Schools Sports Council for his contributions to the CCA. This is the second consecutive time an ACSIAN received this honourable award.

Anirudh has been an integral part of the school team for 6 Years, helping the side to 5 Golds and 1 Silver. He has exhibited hard work, diligence and perseverance in improving himself constantly. He played several crucial knocks to help the team when they were in trouble this season, applying himself and helping them to victory in the tournament, while also top scoring in the finals. He is a leader on and off the pitch, leading by example in the passion and desire he shows during training, always putting in maximum effort, which is successfully carried over into matches.

On behalf the teachers and the CCA Members we wish him many more success in the years to come.

Congratulations and well done Anirudh, Keep up the good work.

Mr Mohamed Shariff

Teacher In charge – Cricket CCA.
