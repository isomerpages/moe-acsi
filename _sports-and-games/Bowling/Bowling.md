The ACS(I) Bowling team has an illustrious history and prides itself on our achievements, the good character of our bowlers and our team spirit. We believe in giving our best and being worthy ambassadors of the school.

Our team has done exceedingly well in recent editions of the National School Games. Since 2018, we have won at least 2 division championship titles per year. In 2024, we were crowned B and C Division boys champions, with the A Division boys and girls teams finishing 1st runner-ups. We give all glory to God and firmly believe that The Best Is Yet To Be!
