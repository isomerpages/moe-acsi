The ACS(I) Bowling team has an illustrious history and prides itself on our achievements, the good character of our bowlers and our team spirit.Â We believe in giving our best and being worthy ambassadors of the school.

Our team has done exceedingly well in recent editions of the National School Games. Since 2018, we have won 2 division championship titles per year. This year, our A and B division teams were crowned champions in convincing fashion. We give all glory to God and firmly believe that The Best Is Yet To Be!
