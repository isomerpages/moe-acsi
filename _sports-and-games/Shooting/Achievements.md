### 2023

      
In 2023, our ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division shooters from the ACS (Independent) Shooting CCA competed in the National School Games (NSG). In preparation for the NSG, our shooters trained tirelessly, always giving their best and striving for excellence in their sport, despite challenges to balance their academic commitments with their rigorous training schedules.

We are proud to announce that our shooters’ hard work has paid off, and that they have achieved commendable results in all categories. 2023 was also the first year with individual finals since 2019 due to the pandemic, and hence competing in the finals was a new experience for most of us, myself included. The results are as follows:

We are extremely proud of our shooters’ dedication and achievements, as well as their perseverance to excel in the sport. These achievements have been made possible not only through our shooters’ own hard work, but also the constant support and encouragement from our teachers, Mrs. Ho-Toh Ling Lee, Ms. Mazlind and Mr. Teo Eng Han, throughout their NSG journey. We must also not forget the guidance and mentorship from our patient coaches, Coach Fan Xiaoping and Coach Gai Bin, and above all God.

To God be the glory, the best is yet to be!
