### 2022

In the year of 2022, our ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division shooters from the ACS (Independent) Shooting CCA competed in the National School Games (NSG). In preparation for the NSG, our shooters trained tirelessly, always giving their best and striving for excellence in their sport. It was challenging for them as they had to balance their academic commitments with their rigorous training schedules. We are proud to announce that our shooters’ hard work has paid off, and that they have achieved commendable results in all categories.

The results are as follows:
