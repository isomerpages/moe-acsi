The ACS(I) Parent Support Group (PSG) organised a Kopi Morning session on 9 March 2023 at the Boarding School Staff Lounge for ACS(I) parents. Similar to last year’s Kopi Morning, it was an informal social event for new parents to meet and mingle with fellow parents over sumptuous light refreshments. 

This year’s session was attended by parents across all levels. The occasion was graced by Deputy Principal, Mdm Yong Lee Har, who gave a heart-warming Welcome speech. The PSG had set up a merchandise stall which allowed parents to buy school memorabilia. Parents who were more experienced shared their personal observations and insights gained while accompanying their sons’ journey in ACS(I) and this served as an encouragement to many. 

Kopi Morning has certainly forged new friendships and provided an opportunity for fellowship amongst parents in the ACS(I) family.
