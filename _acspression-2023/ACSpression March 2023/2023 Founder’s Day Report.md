On 1 March 2023, the school family came together for a morning of celebration, commemorating the 137th anniversary of the founding of Anglo-Chinese School. Being the first full-scale celebration after the pandemic, there was much enthusiasm amongst the school family.

The Founder’s Day parade and badge pinning ceremony did not go ahead as planned due to the inclement weather. Despite the change of plans, it provided an opportunity for class-bonding to celebrate the occasion.

The school family and guests then gathered at Auditorium 2 for the unveiling of the Honour Roll and the Thanksgiving Service. The unveiling of the Honour Roll ceremony recognised the achievements of our alumni and the development of the school from its humble beginnings at Amoy Street to the seven ACS units across Singapore and the region.

The Thanksgiving Service recognised the accomplishments of recently graduated students and dedicated teachers and staff. It was accompanied by melodious hymns performed by the Wall of Sound. The service ended with a passionate rendition of the school anthem.

According to Ryan Toh from 6.12, “Founder’s Day is a celebration of how the ACS family and spirit has grown over the years”. It was certainly a memorable day for the entire school family.
