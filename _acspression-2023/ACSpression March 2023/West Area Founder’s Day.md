On 25 February, the ACS(I) Scouts took part in the West Area Founder’s Day Rally, commemorating 116 years of Scouting Worldwide, and 107 years in Singapore. The inter-troop event involving Scouts of all ages was held at the Assumption Pathway School.

The Scouts took part in multiple activities such as the three-legged race, scarf relay race and flagstaff building competition. The AC Scouts built a mighty structure and emerged victorious for the flagstaff building competition.
