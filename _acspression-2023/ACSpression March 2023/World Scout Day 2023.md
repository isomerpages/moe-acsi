On 23 February, the ACS(I) Scout Troop observed Scout Founder’s Day in commemoration of the birth of Lord Robert Baden Powell, the founding father of the worldwide Scouting movement.

Dr Jasper Wang, a former ACSian, presently a Singapore Armed Forces Medical Scholar, who most notably made the news when his team won the illustrious Defence Technology prize for their ground-breaking medical research graced the ceremony.

As the parade contingent stood at attention, Dr Wang and Mr Koh delivered speeches that affirmed the core values of Scouting. Blessed with words of prayer from Dr Andrew Yong, the Scouts renewed the Scout Promise, pledging their best efforts to help people, and to preserve the Scout Law.
