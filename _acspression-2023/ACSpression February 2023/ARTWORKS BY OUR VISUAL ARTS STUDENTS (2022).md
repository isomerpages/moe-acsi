Title of the art piece    _Ah Gong (2022)_

Media                          Acrylic on canvas

Dimensions                 51 x 51 cm

This diptych illustrates my relationship with my maternal grandfather during my childhood. Soft colours represent pure memories and the vibrant colours and simpler shapes resemble those of a child’s artwork. I wanted to pay a tribute to Ah Gong (grandfather in Hokkien) as he has supported my art journey since young – keeping a drawer full of scrap paper for me to draw on, and regularly buying me coloured pens which I doodled with. I would not be here without his support.

Title of the art piece    _Rooted in Promise (2022)_

Media                          Acrylic and oil on canvas

Dimensions                 91 x 91 cm

Friendships don’t last forever. This was something that I struggled to come to terms with when one of my best friends started to drift away from me. Friendships and memories may fade away, previous commitments to each other might not be kept forever, and though our lives have intertwined – an irreversible past, we may go our separate ways as individuals. The overlapping of foliage is akin to how our lives are still interconnected in some ways.
