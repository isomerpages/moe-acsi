<p><em>Benjamin Boi Yen Ming 6.12&nbsp;</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I woke up and got dressed (2/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The alarm rang and I did my first sit up of the day. My Chinese New Year fit was simple - it was in coordination with other boys in class, where we decided beforehand to wear the same white, traditional Chinese shirt draped over school pants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>+ve:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing really.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-ve:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The bed was warm.</li>
<li>I was sleepy.</li>
<li>The air was cold.</li>
<li>I could not reach my alarm to snooze.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>We had class celebrations (8/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It started off with a pastoral care lesson on Chinese New Year traditions. It was very interesting. The lesson was followed by my class singing Chinese New Year related songs. There was a video recording of the song for everyone to sing along to but it was not <em>hype</em> enough. So the class committee requested I play the guitar and for everyone to sing along. That was truly rather <em>hype</em>.</p>
<p><strong>+ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spontaneous performance.</li>
<li>Class ambiance was great.</li>
<li>Gong Xi Gong Xi is a<em> banger.</em></li>
<li>Learning about Chinese culture.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Low key sweating when strumming.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Mass celebrations (8/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We entered Auditorium 2. My class was seated at the very front of the upper gallery where we had the best view of the performances. It was especially nice to see our fellow classmates perform on stage!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>+ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Friends performed.</li>
<li>Front view seats.</li>
<li>Everyone was in great spirits.</li>
<li>Balloons decorated the aisle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The concert was a little short.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>I took some photos with friends (10/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>School celebrations ended really early so I stayed behind to take photos. One of the best photos I took was with Mr Arene Koh and other cohort mates who had dressed up for Chinese New Year. Instead of the usual “cheese”, we yelled a resoundingly loud “huat ah” that echoed through the building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking photos with friends who had dressed up in traditional costumes was especially meaningful too.</p>
<p><strong>+ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have taken photos with many people now.</li>
<li>Could explore fun poses.</li>
<li>New WhatsApp profile picture.</li>
<li>CNY fit didn’t go to waste.</li>
<li>Took a photo with the principal.</li>
<li>Took a photo with Blaise and her epic <em>HanFu</em>.</li>
<li>Took a photo with guys in my class who wore the same fit mimicking the furious five.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CNY fit was hot.</li>
<li>Accidentally insulted some people’s fit.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>MacDonald’s prosperity burger (huat/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What better way to end the day than with friends at MacDonald’s talking to friends over an overpriced hearty prosperity burger upsized meal?</p>
<p><strong>+ve:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tasted great.</li>
<li>Curly fries.</li>
<li>Good company.</li>
<li>Won all the friendly brawl stars matches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overpriced</li>
<li>It was quite crowded.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Gym (10/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>And to end the day I went to the gym at my house.</p>
<p><strong>+ve:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit some PRs.</li>
<li>Burnt off prosperity burger calories.</li>
<li>Felt empty cause of early dismissal.</li>
<li>Remembered to bring my earbuds.</li>
<li>Felt sore over the long weekend.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-ve:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Had to do some cardio. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall: 7.6/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Remarks: </strong>In all honesty the CNY celebrations were a great time to take a breather from the mundane timetable and spend time with friends. Celebrations like these are far and few between so treasure every opportunity to organize fun activities and dress up!&nbsp;</p>
