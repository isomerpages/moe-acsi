On 5 July 2023, ACS(I) held its annual blood drive in conjunction with the schoolâ€™s Youth Day celebration. In a remarkable display of community spirit, the school family comprising students, staff, parents and alumni came together to donate blood.

The generosity and patience displayed by our school community were truly inspiring, with many students chatting and exploring the Year 6 Gratitude Day booths while waiting patiently for their turn to donate blood. The school is proud of everyone involved in this initiative - from the dedicated committee to the selfless donors, proving how even small actions can make a significant impact.
