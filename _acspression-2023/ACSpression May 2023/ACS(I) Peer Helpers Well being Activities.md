In Term 2, the Peer Helpers organised a series of events to promote well-being in the school. On 27 April, they organised a fundraiser selling donuts to raise funds to buy necessities for migrant workers. The event, “Sprinkle MI Life with Kindness”, aimed at encouraging ACsians to contribute to society and show their appreciation for migrant workers.  
Donuts sold during the fundraiser came along with a sticker and a handwritten encouragement card by our Peer Helpers. All proceeds from this fundraiser will be used to fund necessities for migrant workers through the organisation, “Its Raining Raincoats”.

**Subsequently on 5 May 2023, the Peer Helpers organised a workshop titled “Mental Wellness in a Digital Age” to help students utilise digital resources to address mental health issues. The workshop was supported by SHINE Children and Youth Services. Through the workshop, students learnt about the different digital tools and websites to manage their mental health. From websites such as mindline.sg to myloh.co, an ‘e-buddy’ that serves as a personal mobile cheerleader, the information-packed session enthralled and engaged every student. It was an enriching and fulfilling session.**
