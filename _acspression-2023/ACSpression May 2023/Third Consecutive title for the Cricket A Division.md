On 26 April, our A Division Cricket Team played against Raffles Institution in the finals of the National School Games Cricket Championships at the Singapore Cricket Club Dempsey Field. After a valiant battle, the team brought glory to the school, emerging as the overall champions.

After electing to bat first, the players were restricted to a low total, but showed resilience to pull off a 7-run victory in the penultimate over of the game. We would like to thank the Senior Administration, our teachers Mr Shariff, Mr Deven, Mdm Kavita and Mdm Hafiza. We are also grateful to our coaches Mr Sarika, Mr Deepak and Mr Kunal for their guidance throughout the tournament.
