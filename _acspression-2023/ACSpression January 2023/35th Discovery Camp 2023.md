We welcomed the Year 1s on 3 January and from the get-go, they participated in our six-day Discovery Camp with enthusiasm. With “Our Heritage, Our Family, Our ACS” as our theme, the camp aimed to initiate our Year 1s into the rich and long-standing culture of our school.

The students enjoyed everything there was to offer – Performing Arts showcases, CCA trials and Sports Bazaar, and learned more about the school in School, House Orientation and team building activities.

The camp concluded on a high note with the Badge Pinning Ceremony where parents proudly took part in the induction of their sons into our school and culture. Kudos to the Prefects, ACSplorers and House leaders who took great care of their Year 1 juniors.
