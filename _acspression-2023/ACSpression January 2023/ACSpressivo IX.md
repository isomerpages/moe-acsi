Returning live on 28 October 2022,&nbsp;_ACSpressivo IX_&nbsp;re-imagined the concept of interdisciplinary work through a musical concert held in CPA2 in conjunction with an Art Exhibition at the Art Centre. This provided an exciting platform to showcase the students’ artistic and musical talents.

_ACSpressivo IX_&nbsp;featured a diverse repertoire performed by ACS(I) MEP students and students who are enrolled at our school’s MEP centre. This was also a collaboration with students from Queensway Secondary School. The concert showcased our students’ multi-disciplinary works related to music, poetry, and art.

We would like to thank God, without whom none of this would have been possible, the Senior Administration, especially our Principal, Mr Arene Koh, and our Deputy Principal, Mr Patrick Soo, for their continued encouragement, the teachers of the Aesthetics Department for their guidance, and the audience for their support.
