<p>The journey to the B Division National School Games Tennis Finals had been an arduous one. We had defeated St. Andrews Secondary, Victoria School, and St. Joseph's Institution in the preliminary rounds, before advancing past our brother school, ACS (Barker) with a hard fought 3-2 win in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>We played Raffles Institution on 29th March in the finals. Reminding ourselves of the work we had done to get here, we played our hearts out and left everything out on the court. Eventually, with the encouragement from our supporters, parents, Coach Hock Chai and Coach Hassan, and our teachers-in-charge, Ms Audrey Tay, Ms Au Pui Fun and Mr Roy Gan, we went on to clinch the B Division Title with a score of 3-2. We thank God for guiding us throughout the season.</p>
