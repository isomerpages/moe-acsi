I stepped into the school hall, feeling disorganised and stressed, dressed in my black blazer, and sweating a little from running to the venue. It was 7.15 AM; we were supposed to arrive at 7 AM. That morning, the Student Leaders’ Investiture 2022 that took place was one of the most memorable school events to me. Not only for the obvious reason that it marked the start of my student leadership journey in AC, but also for something I experienced during the event— the loud chorus during the singing of the school song that came from the parents.

After these few months in AC, I realised that the AC spirit was really strong but that experience made me realise exactly how strong it was. The pride emanating from the group of parents who were clearly ex-AC boys and the confidence with which they were singing the school song that they probably sing once a year really spoke about how much they loved the school and how much they valued the chance to sing the iconic school song with a group of AC students again. Thinking back to that moment when I witnessed and felt the AC pride literally flowing from the group of parents, I thought of another event that gave me the same feeling.

The 2022 Rugby A Division Finals. Although I was not there to cheer for the school team on the day itself, simply looking through the numerous pictures posted on Indeponline or our Editorial Board Members’ Flickr accounts gave me a sense of pride.

As the saying goes,  “A picture speaks a thousand words”, I could feel the sense of pride flowing through the Rugby team as a split second of them lifting the huge, shiny A Division trophy was caught on camera. I could feel the exhilaration running through the crowd as the camera caught the moment our school took the lead and the crowds erupted in celebration. I could even sense the joy from the parents who came down to support the team. I was not there but I could sense all this through a few minutes of scrolling through the pictures, showing me how strong the AC spirit and pride is.

I never really expected to have such a strong feeling for a school I joined just a year ago, but I think all ACSians can agree that the AC spirit and environment of play and fun in school is one of the things they love most about being in AC. For me, the pride that all AC students possess is something I really treasure and enjoy in the school, and something that  I would dearly miss once I leave AC at the end of the year.

To all the Year 5s, treasure every moment you spend in the school, especially this year. In AC, you will spend most of your time getting stressed over promos, exams and university applications but also make the most beautiful memories and interact with the people who could stay in your life for years to come. Make the most of your time in this school and cherish every moment.
