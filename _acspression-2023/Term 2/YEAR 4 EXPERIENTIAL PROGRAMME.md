The Year 4 students participated in the Experiential Programme (EP) from 22 to 24 March. In alignment with our holistic approach to education, the programme was designed to provide an opportunity for students to learn beyond the confines of the classroom. It also aimed to familiarise students with their future home and career landscape and encourage reflections on the following:

* the Singapore they will inhabit as adults,
* the role they must play in Singapore’s sustainable living future (Singapore Green Plan 2030),
* the new career landscape tied closely to the changing face of Singapore’s economy.

The diverse activities included Team Building games, Amazing Race, Sustainable Chef Challenge, and a Sustainable Hike, which fostered unity among the students, built resilience, promoted collaboration, and facilitated self-awareness. These aspects of character-building are essential for the students to grow into confident and empathetic adults who care for others and the environment.
