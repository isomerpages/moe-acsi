We had all looked forward to growing up when we were children. Being independent, making our own decisions, exploring our magnificent dreams – these all seemed to be ages away then. As we moved on from the innocence of childhood and started to learn more about the world, we soon came to realise that adulthood is not the fantasy that we once imagined it to be. The excitement of being an astronaut, a firefighter, or a chef; is replaced by an inevitable dread of the responsibilities of adulthood. The lure of an exhilarating job is lost to endless stress over exams, IAs and other commitments. At the same time, the mere thought about having to juggle bills, financial security, and long working hours seem dull and daunting.
 
However, time waits for nobody and before we know it, our IB exams would have ended. We would then be looking forward to the next stage of life. Outside of the sheltered ACS bubble, there are so many new experiences to be had, and lessons to be learned. However, I cannot help but question – am I ready for what is to come next? Am I ready for adulthood?
 
Adulthood is simply the time between adolescence and death. However, this simple definition fails to capture the social and personal significance of adulthood. Being an adult carries sentiment of increased, responsibility, emotional and cognitive stability, and a complete notion of one’s identity. Meanwhile, adulthood is simultaneously presented as monotonous, colourless, and tedious in much of its media representation. the various perceptions, presentations, and unspoken expectations of adulthood leave many of us confused and fearful.
 
When I look back at the significant ‘milestones’ in my life, a common theme runs through them. While uncertainty breeds a fear that is always present, life has a way of preparing us to overcome new challenges. Back in primary 1, PSLE felt like an insurmountable hurdle that I would never be able to get through. Yet, without even realising it, my experiences from then until primary 6 prepared me for what was to come. The same truth struck me on the first day in ACS(I), the first time leading a camp in year 4, and so much more. 
 
Many of us still feel lost about our own identities. We have yet to figure out where we belong in the world, what kind of people we want to be, and what kind of impact we want to make with our lives. We also carry with us insecurities, personal struggles, and hurt from the past. None of us have life figured out yet, and that is completely fine. Moving forward into adulthood, new struggles will come, but we can be confident that they will eventually become just a small part of our past, that we would have learned and grown from. Experiences that we will eventually be glad that we have gone through.
 
Many lessons can be gleaned from simply taking the time to reflect on our experiences; lessons that will help us face even more trials, even more deterrents, and even more milestones in the future. 
 
Finally, let us not forget that through the journeys of life, including this transition into adulthood, we are not alone. Friends, family and most importantly God, will always be there when you need help. Simply being there and supporting each other can also go a long way. 
 
Anticipating adulthood is undeniably scary, and we all have our own individual anxieties and worries about growing up. However, by keeping this transition in perspective, and committing to live with hope, we can be sure that we will all turn out fine.
