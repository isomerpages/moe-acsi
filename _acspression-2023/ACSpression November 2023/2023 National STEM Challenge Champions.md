<p><strong><u>2023 National STEM Challenge Champions</u></strong></p>
<p>On <strong>August 24</strong>, the Year 3 National STEM Challenge team, comprising Ken&nbsp;Yokota&nbsp;Soh, Lim&nbsp;Yong&nbsp;Cen&nbsp;Aiden, Reyes&nbsp;Lee&nbsp;Yui&nbsp;Hou and Emmanuel&nbsp;Soon&nbsp;Yi&nbsp;En from class 3.10, <strong>surpassed all expectations</strong> by defeating the reigning champions, Raffles Institution by <strong>securing the school's first-ever national STEM championship trophy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Formerly the National Science Challenge</strong>, the National STEM Championship has stood out for its <strong>interdisciplinary, hands-on approach</strong> since 2002, involving competitors in a series of challenges and scientific presentations related to STEM topics. The team's journey demanded <strong>indefatigable dedication</strong>, with <strong>invaluable guidance</strong> from their science teachers. During the gruelling grand finale at MediaCorp, the team drew strength from the <strong>encouragement and cheers</strong> of their teachers and schoolmates.</p>
<p>The team expresses their <strong>deepest gratitude</strong> to their teachers and the senior administration for their prayers and support.</p>
