On 14 October 2022, the school commemorated the tenth anniversary of the Humanities Scholarship Programme (HSP) in ACS(I).&nbsp;The HSP and the Accelerated Class of Humanities (ACH) students had a fireside chat with the HSP alumni from&nbsp;the pioneer batches of students. The HSP alumni&nbsp;shared their various experiences in sectors such as Law, Economics, Finance, Marketing and&nbsp;Transport.

They discussed how the Humanities subjects enabled them in analysing information, providing a deeper insight into human interactions and cultures. This also shaped their perspectives toward&nbsp;different global issues. They mentioned that the art of persuasive communication was essential in their fields of work.

The alumni regaled their youthful audience&nbsp;with fond memories from their time spent in the HSP.

&nbsp;_“Our class looks forward to creating unforgettable adventures throughout the rest of our time in the HSP.”_
