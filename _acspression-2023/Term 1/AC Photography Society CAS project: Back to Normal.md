In 2022, the year 5 students of Photography Society embarked on a CAS project, with the goal of preserving memories of our schoolâ€™s return to normalcy and precious moments of school life. From unstructured play on the AstroTurf to a whole school morning chapel and CCA practices, we captured photographs of these increasingly commonplace pre-pandemic activities. We captured moments of unspoken heroes behind the scenes.
