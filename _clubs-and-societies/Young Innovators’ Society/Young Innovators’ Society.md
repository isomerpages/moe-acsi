Welcome to YIS!

At YIS, we seek to effect change through our various passions in the field of making. We welcome students of all skill levels, and no prior experience is required. Our lab boasts state-of-the-art 3D printers and laser cutters, as well as a range of hard and electronic tools.

As we equip our members with skills in 3D design and electronics, we encourage them to find issues in daily life and empathize with those facing them to design better solutions. The ultimate goal is to integrate both worlds to enable everyone who walks through our doors to be a catalyst for change.

We welcome projects of all kinds, from school-wide VIA endeavours to courseworks and EEs, and even personal projects out of hobby or interest. We are determined to arm you with the knowledge to bring those ideas into reality.

Take a look around our page to see our key team members, learn about what we do, and spot our members in action! This is how we’re making a difference, one step at a time.

See you in the lab!
