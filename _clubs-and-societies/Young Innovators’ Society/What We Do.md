_Innovation & Technology (I&T) Training_

During the 2020 December Holidays, we organized the very first I&T training for staff in ACS(I)! We delivered an experience of 3D design and laser-cutting to 14 of our very own teachers, with a close ratio of student-leaders to teachers to personally guide each teacher. The feedback from the session was positive as the teachers were introduced to a new world of lesson possibilities!

_Values in Action (VIA) Projects_

In 2021, YIS is adding a different dimension to VIA projects by equipping Year 2 students with skills in laser cutting. Through a series of sessions, YIS aims to expose the students to ways they can integrate technology into their service of others. This program also provides leadership opportunities for YIS members to guide their peers in various techniques.

_IDEX Training_

IDEX has become a mainstay event for innovation in recent years at ACS(I), drawing students from across the continent to showcase ideas to benefit humanity. This year, YIS partners with IDEX to develop participants’ design thinking skills through a range of courses. By inculcating these soft skills, we hope to make ACSians critical thinkers with the ability to brainstorm effective solutions.

 _Competitions_

Despite being a new CCA, YIS has already clinched awards in the SUTD 3D Printing and Design Innovation Challenge and Engineering Innovation Challenge. In 2021, we welcome you to test your skills in the two aforementioned competitions, as well as the SUTD Electrical Vehicle Challenge and Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition. More details can be found under the FAQ tab!

 _Training Modules_

Every Wednesday, we provide lessons on 3D design using Autodesk Fusion 360 and 2D design on Inkscape, exploring new skills with various case studies and examples. In addition, we teach how to translate these designs into tangible products by operating our 3D printers and laser cutters. As a member, you will have access to a growing library of learning resources to hone your skills at your own pace. We are also looking to explore skills with the Arduino circuit board and programming languages in the near future!

_YIS Taskmaster and Games_

Aside from our training curriculum, we organize monthly games centered around critical thinking to encourage our members to think outside the box. We also integrate problem-statement challenges in YIS Taskmaster, a reward-based program inspired by a British game show. By urging our members to come up with original solutions to simple, unrestricted problems, we blend technical skills with the innovation mindset to develop PILOTs.
