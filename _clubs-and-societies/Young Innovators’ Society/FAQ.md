**Training FAQ**  

1.  **What is YIS and what does the CCA do?**

We are a tech-based CCA focusing on innovative ideas, including finding a solution to a problem, or improving an existing idea. Our CCA offers training on 2D and 3D Modelling using Fusion 360, 3D printers, laser cutters, electronics and hard tools. 

2.  **What is the training schedule for YIS?**

Our official training day is Wednesday 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm. The lab may be open on Tuesdays and Thursdays 3.00 pm to 5.00 pm for members who want to finish their projects or use the lab equipment, but members are required to inform our teacher ICs or any EXCO member beforehand, as the lab may not be open if no one is expected to be present. 

3.  **Where is the CCA usually held at?**

Our base of operations is the Changemaker Lab (Physics Lab 4, Level 2) at the IB Block. 

4.  **Is there a selection trial for YIS?**

No, there is no selection trial or tryouts and we welcome any student regardless of their background. 

5.  **What leadership opportunities does YIS provide?**

Currently, we have Executive Committee positions that are elected once every year, and will be given to experienced members who show strong potential in leading YIS. As we are a fairly new CCA, there is great potential for students to effect the change they want to see. More leadership opportunities may arise if our membership increases in the future.

6.  **Do I need any prior knowledge to join YIS?**

No, we accept anyone regardless of their background. Having prior experience will be beneficial as your learning process will be faster, but we still teach everything from a beginner’s standpoint.

7.  **Can I use the lab equipment for my own projects?**

Members are encouraged to create their own projects and will receive support from the CCA as much as possible. The usage of equipment will be considered on a case-by-case basis, but as long as it is of a reasonable time and cause, it will most likely be approved. 

8.  **Will I be allowed to use the lab for personal projects if they stretch beyond the specified session timings?**

Any requests to use equipment from the lab outside of scheduled timings (e.g. large-scale projects) will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

9.  **Are there any limitations to what I can make in the lab?**

Yes. As per the MOE guidelines: Anyone who uses or displays any 3D-printed replica arms and causes harassment, alarm or distress, or fear of violence to any person, may be prosecuted for an offence. In addition, users of our 3D printers must fill in a logbook everytime the printers are used.
