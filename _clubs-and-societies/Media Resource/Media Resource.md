The Media Resource Team is a dynamic service-oriented CCA which seeks to support the school in all things related to media. This entails audio and video support for the various events held by the school including chapels, concerts, celebrations, and the like.

Our members are trained by senior student members as well as our own in-house specialists to handle our sophisticated equipment and provide support for the numerous events held by the school. Throughout their term of service, they will learn to operate audio mixers, lighting boards, and projectors, among others. Members will learn to operate equipment both within and outside of the various school venues and facilities. This will be carried out though both training sessions and through experience gained by volunteering and being assigned to duties.

We are ever-present in the major events held by the school, and carry the burden of providing support for school events all year round. Our main aim is to provide excellent service of a high standard to the school and its CCAs.

If you are game for a good challenge and you have a heart to serve others, then the MR team welcomes you!
