CASL is a requirement for IB diploma. Through the years, our year 5 photog members have exhibited creativity by thinking of CAS projects that are relevant to meet the needs of our beneficiaries.

Some of the past CASL projects include:

1.&nbsp;Teaching photography to pupils from Pathlight School (2016)

The training culminates in a trip to Botanic Garden where pupils from both schools had fun with photography while immersed in nature.
