<p><strong>Welcome!</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome to the ACS (Independent) Photographic Society — fondly known as
Photog! Our club is the home for passionate photography enthusiasts eager
to explore and deepen their craft. As the visual chronicler of our school's
most significant moments, we document the myriad of events and celebrations
that define the heart and soul of ACS(I), turning fleeting moments into
lasting memories.</p>
<p><strong>What do we do during CCA meetings?</strong>
</p>
<p>At Photog, our journey is as much about learning as it is about creating.
We offer a comprehensive array of training sessions, guided by seasoned
professionals from the broader photographic community as well as skilled
peers within the club. Whether you’re exploring the fundamentals of photography
or delving into advanced techniques, there is always a place here for growth.</p>
<p>Photog is more than just a haven for learning — it is a community built
on strong bonds and shared passion. Our club thrives on camaraderie, with
regular bonding sessions to strengthen friendships and encourage collaboration
among members, creating lifelong friendships alongside unforgettable memories.</p>

<p><em>A Sneak Peek into our Bonding Sessions</em>
</p>
<p>Occasionally, we have the privilege of hosting esteemed guest speakers
who offer a window into their world, inspiring us with their experiences
and insights into the world of photography. A memorable example was our
session with Mr. Russel Wong, whose humility and perseverance left an indelible
impression on our CCA.</p>
<p>Our adventures often extend beyond the familiar confines of the campus.
From night photography at Merlion Park and Chinatown to architectural shoots
at the Esplanade and the Central Business District, as well as street photography
sessions, we offer a wide spectrum of opportunities to challenge and expand
our skills.&nbsp; These authentic experiences bring theory to life, giving
us the chance to experiment, push creative boundaries, and see the world
anew through our lenses.</p>

<p>Photog also boasts an impressive arsenal of equipment. When shooting for
school events, members have access to an extensive collection of Canon
DSLR, mirrorless camera bodies, lenses, tripods, and other essential gear.
As their passion and expertise grow, many of our members have gone on to
invest in their own gear, taking their craft to new heights.</p>
