**Welcome everyone!**¬†

The ACS (Independent) Photographic Society, also known affectionately as Photog in short, is a place where photography enthusiasts get a chance to explore their interests vividly. Its primary aim is to document school events. However it is also a CCA where members can develop their ideas and skills further with training from our own talented members!

**What do typical meetings look like?**

There is no boring routine to follow in every weekly training session. Every week, we have either internal or external trainers who will enhance our skill sets and knowledge on various genres, processing the photos, tips to improve and more!¬† We also have relaxing bonding sessions where members build camaraderie ship through games.

Sometimes we also invite guest speakers to motivate us and equip us with the required knowledge to reach greater heights! We had invited Mr Russel Wong and we are awed by his humbleness and perseverance.

Listening to experts in this field may be very useful but the lessons learnt only come to fruition when we put our skills to the test. Holding the camera and exploring the world of photography hands-on is an authentic experience for any budding photographer! üì∏ We have had interesting night photography sessions at Merlion Park and Chinatown, Architecture photography at CBD and Chinatown and also street photography among other exciting genres!

We provide ample opportunities for you to practice your skills and at the same time serve the school by shooting for school events. We have a wide range of DSLR camera bodies, lens, tripods and other items that members can borrow. Many members have gone on to purchase cameras of their own as they develop further in this hobby.
