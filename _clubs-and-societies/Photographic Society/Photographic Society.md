**Welcome!**

Welcome to the ACS (Independent) Photographic Society — fondly known as Photog! Our club is the home for passionate photography enthusiasts eager to explore and deepen their craft. As the visual chronicler of our school's most significant moments, we document the myriad of events and celebrations that define the heart and soul of ACS(I), turning fleeting moments into lasting memories. 

**What do we do during CCA meetings?**

At Photog, our journey is as much about learning as it is about creating. We offer a comprehensive array of training sessions, guided by seasoned professionals from the broader photographic community as well as skilled peers within the club. Whether you’re exploring the fundamentals of photography or delving into advanced techniques, there is always a place here for growth.

Photog is more than just a haven for learning — it is a community built on strong bonds and shared passion. Our club thrives on camaraderie, with regular bonding sessions to strengthen friendships and encourage collaboration among members, creating lifelong friendships alongside unforgettable memories.

_A Sneak Peek into our Bonding Sessions_

Occasionally, we have the privilege of hosting esteemed guest speakers who offer a window into their world, inspiring us with their experiences and insights into the world of photography. A memorable example was our session with Mr. Russel Wong, whose humility and perseverance left an indelible impression on our CCA.

Our adventures often extend beyond the familiar confines of the campus. From night photography at Merlion Park and Chinatown to architectural shoots at the Esplanade and the Central Business District, as well as street photography sessions, we offer a wide spectrum of opportunities to challenge and expand our skills.  These authentic experiences bring theory to life, giving us the chance to experiment, push creative boundaries, and see the world anew through our lenses.

Photog also boasts an impressive arsenal of equipment. When shooting for school events, members have access to an extensive collection of Canon DSLR, mirrorless camera bodies, lenses, tripods, and other essential gear. As their passion and expertise grow, many of our members have gone on to invest in their own gear, taking their craft to new heights.
