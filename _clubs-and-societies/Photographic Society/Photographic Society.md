<p>Step into a world where key moments are captured, stories are told, and
the vibrant spirit of ACSI comes to life through a camera lens. Welcome
to the Photographic Society, affectionately known as Photog, the home for
passionate photography enthusiasts who seek to explore, create, and capture
the stories that define life at ACSI.</p>
<p><strong>What we do</strong>
</p>
<p>At Photog, learning and creativity go hand in hand. Our sessions are a
dynamic blend of technical training, creative explorations, and hands-on
practice every week, led by our experienced student leaders and professionals
from the greater photography community. Whether you are just learning the
basics or solidifying your individualized style, you will find room for
growth and a unique way to express your perspective through the lens. Beyond
developing skills, we place an especially high emphasis on community and
collaboration, with frequent bonding activities, through which members
build connections, exchange ideas, and form the kind of friendships that
extend far beyond the years in school.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights and Experiences of Photog</strong>
</p>
<p>Our learning also extends far beyond the classroom walls. This year, our
members went for field shoots at Haji Lane, the Chinese Garden, shooting
different genres ranging from the bustling scenes of the streets to serene
landscapes. Complementing these real-world shoots are sessions with guest
speakers who share valuable insights and inspiration brought about through
their real-world experiences in the professional photography scene, bringing
the art and industry of photography to life.</p>
<p><strong>Gear up for your journey</strong>
</p>
<p>Members have access to an extensive range of Canon DSLR and mirrorless
cameras, lenses, tripods, and other essential gear for event coverage and
creative shoots.
<br>&nbsp;As their skills and passion deepen, many members choose to invest
in their own equipment, taking their craft to new heights.</p>
