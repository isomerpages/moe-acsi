**SCHEDULE**

We meet every Wednesday from 330-530. 

If you want to learn about photography (e.g., to enhance the pictures in your presentation) and are interested to serve the school at the same time, we welcome you to join us. See you!  

Tentatively, venues for CCA activities are Classrooms B3-06, B3-07, B3-08.
