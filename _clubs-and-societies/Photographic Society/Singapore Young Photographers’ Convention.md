Singapore Young Photography Convention (SYPC)

SYPC started at pupils’ initiative to have a platform for young photographers to learn from one another. It started in 2006 with a conversation between our pupil Alison and Mr Andass Teu of National Youth Achievement Award. And the rest is history!

With NYAA’s faithful partnership, SYPC has grown from strength to strength! What started off as a national competition has become international as the winning team is awarded with an all-expense paid trip to Japan, Higashikawa to take part in a photo fest. \[More of the photo fest can be found here: https://town.higashikawa.hokkaido.jp/intl/en/town-of-photograph/ \] ACS(I) Photog is proud to be the national coordinator for this festival since 2018.

In the most recent SYPC in 2021, a total of 35 schools comprising of 221 teams from around the nation participated. The theme of the competition is “Charm of Our Region”. The judges were Mr Chow Chee Yong, Mr Bernard Teo and Mr Joseph Goh.
