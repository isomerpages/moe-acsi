The Young Diplomats’ Society (YDS) is a co-curricular activity dedicated to teaching the art of diplomacy through Model United Nations (MUN) conferences, where students represent countries in international organisations like the United Nations. YDS aims to prepare its members to actively participate in these prestigious conferences, in the hopes of nurturing competent and responsible individuals. YDS holds weekly training sessions on topics like spontaneous public speaking, critical thinking, and global issues, developing a sensitivity to pressing historical and current issues. Every June, the club organises ACSI’s very own International Model United Nations Conference, attended by students from schools across Singapore.
