The Environment Focus Group is a student – initiated club split into the secondary and IB clubs with the aim to raise environmental awareness among the student population.

The members in the IB section are actively involved in organising different environmental projects. These projects aim to raise environmental awareness within the school and also with the community. They are regulars in promoting events such as the Youth Environment Day (YED) Celebration that falls on April annually.

The members in the Secondary section focus mainly on the Theme of Biodiversity. One key aspect of the club is its hydroponics garden. The students grow different vegetables and is sold periodically after harvesting. Shifted to its new location in 2017, the garden continues to produce quality vegetables for both staff and students.

The club is closely supported by external agencies such as NParks and NEA. We have been participating in the biannual Singapore Garden Festival since Year 2010 and had been awarded the Gardeners’ Cup in 2016. Our school has also achieved the Lotus Award under the School Green Award (SGA).

Moving forward, we plan to develop more passionate ambassadors for nature and environment.
