**Editorial Board (formerly known as School Magazine) - Established in 1927**

The Editorial Board is a dedicated team of graphic designers, photographers, videographers, and motion graphic artists. Emphasising a multidisciplinary approach, the Board applies creativity, diverse skill sets, and passion to support various school functions, with the most significant being the design of the annual yearbook. The team also collaborates closely with the Corporate Communications department to produce videos and other media content.

Requirements:

Candidates must be eager to learn new skills, often on their own time and prior experience in any of the mentioned creative fields is preferred. New members should expect a trial period upon joining. It is important to note that being part of the Editorial Board requires substantial time and commitment.

Past projects include directing and producing music videos that embody ACSI's values, such as "One AC" and "One Family." The Board also works with the Corporate Committee to annually update the School Profile.
