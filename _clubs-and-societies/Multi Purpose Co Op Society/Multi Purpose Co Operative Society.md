**Statement on Co-operatives**

**Definition**

The International Co-operative alliance defines a co-operative as an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.

**Values**

Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality and solidarity. In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.

**Principles**

The co-operative principles are guidelines by which co-operatives put their values into practice.
