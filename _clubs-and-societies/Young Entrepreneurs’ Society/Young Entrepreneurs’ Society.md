The **Young Entrepreneurs’ Society (YES)** started out as part of the Talent Development Programme in ACS (Independent). It is now an established CCA for Year 5 and 6 IB students, conducted weekly on Thursdays, from 4 – 5.30pm.

YES aims to provide a platform for students to develop their interest and skills in areas related to business management, finance, entrepreneurship, techno-preneurship, social enterprises and event management. Members of YES can potentially participate in the following activities to grow or pursue their interest in the field of business and entrepreneurship.

Some of our training events and projects include:

1.  Entrepreneur Mindset Training: We believe that mindset training is the key to becoming a successful entrepreneur and also to prepare our students to face real challenges when they graduate from the school and enter the various industries of their choice.
2.  Young Entrepreneurs’ Challenge: We invite industry specialists as guest speakers and judges for this event where it has a competition which is based on various themes.
3.  Community Projects: As entrepreneurs are change makers in society, we highly regard the aspect of community involvement. Knowledge learned about business and financial management during weekly sessions is shared with underprivileged individuals during tutoring sessions and funds are raised  
    for charities through the businesses built by members.
4.  Talks by Industry Experts: This will strengthen and provide more information for our students to learn about aspects of entrepreneurship and the different industries present. Such talks include learning about financial management, building a business from scratch etc.
5.  Junior Achievement (JA) Company Program: A 12-week mentorship programme guided by industry experts, followed by a company competition where students will learn about the intricate details of running a successful business and present it to a panel of experts.

The following are some of competitions we participate in yearly:

1.  JA International Trade Challenge
