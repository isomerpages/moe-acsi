ACtive ACsians is a CCA that aims to promote a healthy lifestyle and bonding through an array of sports and activities for students to participate and interact with one another. We aim to provide students the opportunity to participate in a sport or physical activity in a friendly, less-competitive setting where no experience is needed. Our students get to stay healthy, have fun, and try a wide variety of activities at the same time.

The pioneer batch of students have participated in sports such as Archery and Akido.Â  Upcoming activities will include team sports and outdoor activities. Students also have the opportunity to design and select in which they have an interest.

**Activity Schedule**: Weekly (Wednesday, 3.30 to 5.00 pm)
