**World School’s Debating Championships 2016**

The World School’s Debating Championships 2016 were held in Stuttgart, Germany. Team Singapore competed against over 50 other countries on the biggest international platform in school debating, winning 6 out of 8 preliminary rounds against South Korea, Philippines, Croatia, Nepal, Montenegro and Nigeria and losing to Netherlands and Canada. Team Singapore then went on to beat Thailand in the Partial Double-Octofinal and lost to Denmark in the Octofinals.

As a part of Team Singapore, I served in an Observer position. This was to say that I trailed the team during the 8 pre-tournament spars in Stuttgart, as well as during the competition. I also participated in events like Cultural Night and Break Night.

From this tournament, I took away 2 key insights. The first is the nature of discourse on an international level as an inherently vibrant and diverse one; we ought not let our worldview be parochial and constrained by our own geographical boundaries. The second is more specific to debate; there are a variety of different approaches taken toward the art of debate – to this end, there are things to be taken away from these different mechanisms.

This was an invaluable experience that will definitely be enshrined in my memory for a long time. For the learning and the memories, I am grateful.
