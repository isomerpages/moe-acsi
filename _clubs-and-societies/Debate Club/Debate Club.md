The ACS (I) Debate Club frequently engages in formal debates in the competitive debating scene and has emerged as one of the more formidable teams in both the secondary school and IB/JC debate circuits. More importantly however, the club consists of like-minded individuals interested in the art of persuasion and the formal science of logic. Club activities afford students the opportunity to hone their skills in argument, succinct expression, public speaking, and time management, and grant students insights into issues sociological, political, economic, and philosophical. Ultimately, debaters gain an ability which remains relevant long after their days as competitive debaters are over.

So, if you want a shot at besting the best of them at argument and persuasion in a competitive environment or just a hobby the use of which is apparent even now in your studies and social life, then the ACS (I) Debate Club is indubitably (or un-debatably) the best CCA for you!
