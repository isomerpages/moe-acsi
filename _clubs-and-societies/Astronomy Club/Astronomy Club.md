Astronomy in ACS has been around since its founding.

In February 1885, the founder of ACS, William Fitzjames Oldham, had just arrived in Singapore. He chanced upon an invitation to interact with a group of Chinese merchants eager for their sons to receive an English education. There, at the beginning of the ACS story, he delivered his speech on Astronomy.

The work Bishop Oldham did over one hundred and thirty years ago continues with the students who share our club’s passion in Astronomy.

Students who join the Astronomy club are aspiring scientists, enthusiasts for the heavens above, and interested in learning beyond the classroom. The club provides opportunities to understand and work with telescopes and equipment, and offers diverse possibilities for creative thinking.
