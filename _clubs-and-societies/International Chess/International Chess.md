<p>The Anglo ̶ Chinese School (Independent) Chess Club’s mission is to allow
our young talents to hone their skills in International Chess.&nbsp; We
also aim to cultivate youth leadership for the students who are interested
in the various areas that our committee is involved in.</p>
<p>With strong support from our school, we seek to give our students exposure
to the national competitions and also encourage them to go for other International
Chess competitions on their own, as well as to maintain old partnerships
with SCF and other Chess bodies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Allocation of Year 1 students to the Chess Club</u></strong>
