The Anglo ̶ Chinese School (Independent) Chess Club’s mission is to allow our young talents to hone their skills in International Chess. We also aim to cultivate youth leadership for the students who are interested in the various areas that our committee is involved in.

With strong support from our school, we seek to give our students exposure to the national competitions and also encourage them to go for other International Chess competitions on their own, as well as to maintain old partnerships with SCF and other Chess bodies.

Our team participates in two competitions annually. These are the

**National Schools Individual Championships \[Usually in March\]**

**National Inter School Team Chess Championships \[Usually in September, with exceptions such as for 2015 and 2020\]**
