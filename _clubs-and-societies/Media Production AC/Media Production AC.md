Inspiring Creativity Through Film and Storytelling

Media Production Anglo-Chinese (MPAC) is a vibrant Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that nurtures students in the art of filmmaking and digital storytelling. Through hands-on experience and guided mentorship, students gain valuable skills in video editing, cinematography, storyboarding, and live event documentation.

Throughout the year, MPAC supports the school community by capturing and producing media coverage for key events such as the Festival of Arts, Founder’s Day, Cross Country, National Day, TOK Focus Day, Honours Day, and Teacher’s Day. Our dedicated team of student videographers and editors work behind the scenes to ensure these moments are professionally documented and archived.

Weekly training sessions are led by well-known local filmmaker Mr Yusri Sapari, who provides students with in-depth guidance on all aspects of video production. Under his mentorship, students learn to plan, shoot, and edit compelling content that reflects the spirit and stories of our school.

In 2024, MPAC launched a Mentorship Programme to guide new members in core production skills such as editing, videography, and storyboarding. Members also take part in internal film competitions designed to foster creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.

MPAC students are regularly prepared to represent the school in national competitions such as the National Youth Challenge, Climate Change Film Competition, Schools Digital Media Awards (SDMA) and MOE, Our School, Our Stories Video Competition.

With creativity at its core, MPAC is more than just a media CCA—it is a platform for students to tell meaningful stories, develop industry-relevant skills, and contribute to the life of the school through visual media. Working closely with teachers-in-charge, MPAC continues to inspire excellence in media production and storytelling.
