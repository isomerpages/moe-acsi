Media Production AC (MPAC) is a CCA that aims to equip students with basic video editing skills, film appreciation and the documentation of various school events throughout the year. It caters to the needs of the school community such as – Performance Arts Night Festival (PANF), Festival of Arts, IDEX, Founder’s Day, Cross Country, Honours Day, National Day, and Teacher’s Day while providing videography service for important school events throughout the year. A dedicated team of MPAC members provide videography and editing support for various school events. Throughout the year, MPAC organizes workshops and talks by well-known personalities from the film and broadcast media such as Mr Joe Phua from the BBC, Singapore. MPAC students undergo regular training sessions on different aspects of filmmaking by local filmmaker Mr Jeremiah Oh. In July 2023, several groups of MPAC students participated in the MOE “MY SCHOOL, MY STORY” short filmmaking competition and received special commendation and certificates of participation. This enabled students to hone their creative, collaborative and filmmaking skills while working together with their respective teams. MPAC members also participate in various film competitions such as National Youth Challenge, Climate Change Film Competition, SDMA and N.E. mation to name a few. Within the school, the MPAC team successfully produced videos for IDEX 2023, CNY celebrations, Founder’s Day and PANF promo videos. MPAC offers students a safe and relaxing environment which enable students to forge friendships while exploring the exciting world of digital media. Together with the teachers, MPAC’s dedicated team members work tirelessly towards providing quality service to the school community.
