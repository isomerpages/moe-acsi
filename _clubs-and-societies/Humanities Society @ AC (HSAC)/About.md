<p>&nbsp;<strong>Welcome to HSAC!</strong></p>
<p>Ever wonder why a government’s cabinet is called a ‘cabinet’? Want to learn why you can get away with murder legally in Yellowstone Park? Perhaps analyse the play that inspired the word ‘gaslight’? Then we have the perfect CCA for you!</p>
<p>At Humanities Society AC (HSAC), we carry out weekly sessions to discuss the various branches of the humanities. With our broad range of subjects, you are sure to find something that intrigues you. Interested in history &amp; politics? We got it. Social sciences? We got that covered too. Economics, law, and literature? Check, check, and check. Each session covers a fascinating topic that goes beyond the traditional syllabus, ranging from Cold War atomic spies to doxxing on TikTok. Sessions also involve quizzes, debates, and discussions, providing a platform for all members to interact.</p>
<p>If your appetite for the humanities still isn't satiated, we still have a long list of programmes lined up for you. Ministerial dialogues, as well as lectures from guest speakers, are just some of the activities you may encounter in our sessions. If you want to show off your competitive side, we also offer opportunities to join international competitions and essay tournaments. Excursions are also organised to further members’ knowledge of the humanities, and encourage learning beyond a school setting.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Join our quest to embark on the humanities today!</p>
