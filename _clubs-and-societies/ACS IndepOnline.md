<p>For Year 5 and 6 students only</p>
<p>Originally created as a page for students by students, ACS IndepOnline
now manages our school’s social media presence on both Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>We create and curate content, with the aim of connecting the school community,
parents and alumni by informing them of the school’s activities. From sports
teams to performing arts groups to clubs, Uniformed Groups and even intellectual
fields, we celebrate every achievement and effort, big and small. We aim
to embody the ACS spirit in all we do and hope to inspire our followers
through the content.</p>
