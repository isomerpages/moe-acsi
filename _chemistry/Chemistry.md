Chemistry is the branch of natural science that deals with the study of matter. It is about the study of the compositions and properties of substances, and how they react with one another. Chemistry is also known as the Central Science as it connects the other natural sciences such as physics, astronomy, biology, life sciences, and geology.

At Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Chemistry enjoys great popularity. In the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, we have about 800 students offering Chemistry, with at least 700 students pursuing it at the Higher Level.

The Chemistry Department has 23 Chemistry teachers to ensure that our students are sufficiently challenged and enthused through the close interaction between students and teachers. In addition, the teachers are supported by a dedicated group of 6 laboratory technicians working in 6 Chemistry Laboratories.
