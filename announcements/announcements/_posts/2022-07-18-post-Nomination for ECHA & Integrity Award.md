The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) is introduced by Ministry of Education in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.  This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore in order to broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded.

The Integrity Award is set up in 2021 by the Anglo-Chinese School Foundation to recognise ACS students who displays the highest level of integrity.

The nominations for both categories are now open. Please find more details here: [/student-development/moe-echa/](https://staging.d270c0tj2w26u.amplifyapp.com/student-development/moe-echa/)
