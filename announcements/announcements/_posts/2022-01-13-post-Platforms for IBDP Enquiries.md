**ACS(I) International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP)**

Anglo-Chinese School began with a providential call to Methodist Reverend William Fitzjames Oldham to establish a mission in Southeast Asia. Oldham’s vision to provide a quality education saw the founding of Anglo-Chinese School in 1886 with the purpose of nurturing students to be of service “for God and humanity”. Our journey began in a small shophouse in Amoy Street with a cohort of 13. We have since come a long way with close to 10,000 strong across the 6 units of ACS school in Singapore.

At ACS (Independent), we continue to strive towards fulfilling Bishop William Oldham’s vision that education should transcend mere acquisition of knowledge and skills and go beyond the preparation to carve out a livelihood; an education should instead broaden the mind and develop the character of our students such that they are catalysts for change for God and Humanity.

**IB Diploma Programme**

The IBDP is made up of 6 subject groups with Extended Essay (EE), Theory of Knowledge (TOK), and Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS) at the core. Students are also required to complete Internal Assessments (IA) coursework, a component that adds up to the final grade for each subject. The challenging yet fulfilling IB curriculum educates the whole student, thereby developing their capacity for inquiry, research and problem-solving, as well as essential skills for communication and collaboration, to become active, compassionate, and lifelong learners.

Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS) is one of the three essential elements that every student must complete as part of the IBDP. The CAS requirement emphasises the importance of life outside the world of scholarship, providing a refreshing counterbalance to the academic pursuits of the programme. The IB goal of educating the whole person and fostering a more compassionate and active citizenry comes alive in an immediate way when students reach beyond themselves and their books. The CAS requirement encourages students to share their energy and special talents with others: students may, for example, participate in theatre or musical productions, sports and community service activities.

Students should, through these activities, develop greater awareness of themselves and concern for others, and the ability to work cooperatively with other people. Its strong emphasis on internationalism, intercultural understanding and making a positive difference to the world while remaining strongly rooted in faith, values, culture, and community fits well with the mission of ACS(I).
