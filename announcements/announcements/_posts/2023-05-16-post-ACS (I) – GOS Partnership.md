On 29 April, we set up a booth with our friends from Grace Orchard School at Fairfield Methodist School’s _Make Me a Blessing_ carnival. We aimed to promote an awareness of people with special needs and raise funds. At the booth, we sold terrariums and taught visitors how to make terrariums.
  
This was the first time we had a joint VIA project with Grace Orchard School, Through this enriching and meaningful project, we forged new friendships and had a lot of fun interacting with one another.
