<p><strong>Wednesday 30 August 2023, Singapore: </strong>Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) [ACS(I)] has been accredited as an ‘Athlete Friendly Education Centre’ (AFEC) from World Academy of Sports<sup>1</sup> (WAoS). As an AFEC, ACS(I) will be better able to further support our top-tier student athletes with the offering of a three-year International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme for these students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;With the accreditation, ACS(I) will receive the following support from WAoS:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Access to the WAoS Athlete Certificate and Teacher Resources</li>
<li>Opportunities to participate in AFEC Professional Development workshops and webinars</li>
<li>Access to resources on individual plans and workload mapping tools to support student athletes</li>
<li>Opportunities to network with Olympians</li>
<li>Potential involvement of staff in schools in the development of new initiatives and resources</li>
</ol>
<p>ACS(I) will offer a three-year IB Diploma Programme to our nation’s top-tier sports students instead of the expected two years from 2024. ACS(I) will work alongside these students and their national coaches to prepare an individual study plan to ensure that the academic plan, including exam arrangements, are mapped out in tandem with the student’s training schedules/competitions. Additional Teaching and Learning resources to better meet the needs of these students, including the availability of learning via online means, will be made available to these sports students when they are away from school. A school personnel will be appointed to liaise with national sports agencies that our students are training with to review their academic and sports programme and help them through the IB Diploma Programme, including their aspirations for university and sports development after their studies in ACS(I).</p>
<p>As a pilot, ACS(I) will collaborate with Singapore Aquatics (SAQ) to curate an individualized pathway for high performing swimmers to have access to SAQ’s training facilities as well as training opportunities with the National swimming squad. More sports will be included in the initiative in due course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this accreditation from WAoS, ACS(I) aims to better support top-tier student athletes who are seeking to balance the twin rigours of a high performing sport and the IB course of studies through the extended IB study pathway.</p>
<p>To God Be The Glory!</p>
<p>The Best Is Yet To Be!</p>
<h6><sup>1</sup> The WAoS AFEC accredits schools which provide flexible learning pathways combined with excellent support services to student-athletes. This combined support enables students to better balance both education and sporting commitments and maintain a dual career approach.</h6>
