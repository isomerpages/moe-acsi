The ACS(I) Open House will be held on **15 April 2023 – Saturday, 8.30am to 12.30pm****.**

Join us to explore our campus, meet our teachers, and learn about our academic and co-curricular programs.

More information will be put up on [https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/events/openhouse/](https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/events/openhouse/) closer to date.

This will be a walk-in event with no registration required. As we have limited parking space in the school, it is recommended that visitors park at the Multi-story carpark opposite the school if you are driving.

We look forward to welcoming you then!
