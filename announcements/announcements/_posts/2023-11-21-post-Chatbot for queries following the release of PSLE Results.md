With the release of the PSLE results, we understand you may have questions about your child's academic journey with us as well as queries about the Year 1 registration process. To streamline this process, we're pleased to introduce our Chatbot accessible via the link below:

This tool is designed to promptly address your queries, providing information about our school, and assisting with concerns you may have with a list of frequently asked questions. 

We look forward to continuing our partnership in fostering a supportive and enriching learning environment.
