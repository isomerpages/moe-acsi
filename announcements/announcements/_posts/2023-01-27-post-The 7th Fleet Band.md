On 11 January 2023, the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Band had the privilege of hosting the U.S. 7th Fleet Band. Our brass members participated in masterclasses led by their members, culminating in the performance of a combined piece, the _Thunderer March_. Thereafter, students from the Band and the Music Elective Programme (MEP) were treated to a performance by the quintet from the 7th Fleet Band, which included the folk song _The Blue Bells of Scotland_ and the movie soundtrack _We Don’t Talk About Bruno_ amongst others.
