Business Management is a dynamic, rigorous, and challenging subject that addresses the rationale for forming organisations and the principles,  practices and skills commonly employed to make the decisions that make them successful. Even though no previous knowledge of the subject is needed     a reasonable level of numeracy and the ability to do research is a key for the subject.
