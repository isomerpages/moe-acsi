**Upcoming Events for 2023!**

Read about our upcoming events to stay engaged with the happenings of the school. If you are interested to help or participate in our events, please [get in touch](https://staging.d270c0tj2w26u.amplifyapp.com/for-parents/acsi-parent-support-group/contact-us/) with us.

All parents, no matter how busy they are, should take an active interest in their children’s school life. This is one of the hallmarks of successful parenting. By staying genuinely interested, it helps us understand what our children experience in their exciting youth. The strong bonds that we build today with our kids will go a long way into adulthood for them, and into old age for us as parents.

We will be posting new announcements regularly to inform you of upcoming events. Follow us on [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/ACSIPSG/) and [**Telegram**](https://t.me/ACSIPSG) for the latest PSG news and updates.
