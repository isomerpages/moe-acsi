One of the primary objectives of the PSG is to support and equip our members and parents of the school with the skills and knowledge to become better parents and to improve their family life and well-being. To that end, the PSG frequently organises talks, seminars and workshops, in collaboration with the school, on topics such as What to Expect in Year 1, Computer Addiction, Parenting with Confidence, Strength-Based Parenting, National Service and What to Expect Beyond ACS(I).

Since 2021, our talks series has included talks which seek to broaden our knowledge and understanding of the new and emerging trends in the local and global economies and the interesting employment and entrepreneurial opportunities which they will afford future generations. We believe that such talks will help parents support and guide their children better as they decide on their chosen career paths.

During the current Covid-19 pandemic, PSG talks, seminars and workshops are still being conducted but have migrated online. Here are some of the talks in the pipeline for **2022**:
