<p>The PSG serves as a bridge between the school and parents. We endeavour to involve parents in&nbsp;collaboration with the school to enrich the school lives of ACS(I) students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Membership and Outreach (M&amp;O) Sub-Committee welcomes parent volunteers for our various PSG&nbsp;activities and provides the opportunity for parents to be engaged with the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One avenue is for interested parents to come on board as Class Representatives, acting as a conduit between the PSG and parents. Class Representatives play a vital role in conveying news and relevant&nbsp;information to parents, and channeling questions and feedback to the PSG and the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The M&amp;O Sub-Committee also holds the following events for parents during the school year:</p>
<p><strong>PSG Orientation</strong></p>
<p>This is organised for new Year 1 parents at the beginning of each year during Discovery Camp. This is where parent volunteers share their own experiences and insight into their son’s ACS(I) journey. Parents&nbsp;have found the event informative and helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Kopi Morning</strong></p>
<p>This breakfast event is held in the second half of Term 1 for Year 1 and Year 5 parents to meet members&nbsp;of the school’s senior administration and fellow school parents (including PSG ExCo members). This&nbsp;informal social gathering is a time of fellowship and sharing, where new parents are welcomed into the&nbsp;school community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parents Appreciation Event</strong></p>
<p>At the end of each academic year, PSG arranges a gathering for all parent volunteers to come together&nbsp;for breakfast. It serves as a way to bring the year to a close but also to strengthen the friendships which&nbsp;have been forged through the year.&nbsp;</p>
