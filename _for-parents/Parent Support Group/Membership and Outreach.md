The PSG serves as a bridge between the school and parents. We endeavour to involve parents in collaboration with the school to enrich the school lives of ACS(I) students.

The **Membership and Outreach** Sub-Committee welcomes parent volunteers for our various PSG activities and provides the opportunity for parents to be engaged with the school.

One avenue is for interested parents to come on board as class representatives, acting as a conduit between the PSG and parents. Class representatives play a vital role in conveying news and relevant information to parents, and channelling questions and feedback to the PSG and school.

**Orientation**

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the **Membership and Outreach** Sub-Committee organised an annual Orientation talk and workshop for new parents at the beginning of each year during Discovery Camp. During the talk and workshop, PSG parents would share their insights on what to expect as a Year 1 student’s parent. New parents would meet fellow parents from their son’s class and get answers to their queries from existing PSG parents on how to support their children’s journey in ACS(I). In 2021, a virtual Orientation Night was held for new parents instead, due to Covid-19 restrictions. Many parents found the event informative and helpful.

**Year 1 and 5 New Parents’ Welcome  
**

Another big event in the PSG’s annual calendar is the Year 1 and 5 New Parents’ Welcome which is usually held at the ACS(I) Boarding School Dining Hall. Fondly termed the “Welcome Night” for many years as the event usually took place in the evening, this is an informal gathering where new parents will get to meet members of the school’s senior administration and “veteran” PSG members (including Exco members). In 2022, the PSG held a “Kopi Morning” to welcome the new Year 1 and 5 Parents, and it was a wonderful time of fellowship and sharing. Be it a “Welcome Night” or a “Kopi Morning” in the future, new Year 1 and 5 parents can look forward to this event every year!

**Parents Appreciation Night**

At the end of each academic year, the PSG organises one final event – Parents Appreciation Night, for all our members to come together for a relaxing evening of dinner and games. It is a great way to bring the year to a close but also to strengthen the friendships which have been forged through the year.

We are hopeful as Singapore transitions into the endemic phase of the pandemic, that the event will be able to run again in 2022.
