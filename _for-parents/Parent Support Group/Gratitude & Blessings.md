The **Gratitude & Blessings** Sub-Committee organises several exciting events during the year to bless the teachers, staff, students, scholars and parents. These include the **Teachers’ Day Lunch** and **Secondary 4 Study Club**.

### **Teachers’ Day Lunch**

To celebrate our teachers and all their tireless hard work, the PSG organises an annual Teachers’ Day lunch. Teachers are the pillars of the school and role models for our children.

### **Secondary 4 Study Club**

Parents contribute afternoon snacks to encourage our O – Level students in their preparation for the preliminary examinations. This simple act of kindness helps to motivate the boys to press on and complete the race to their O – Levels.
