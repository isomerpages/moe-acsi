The Gratitude & Blessings Sub-Committee organises several exciting events during the year to bless the teachers, staff and students. These include the Teachers’ Day Lunch, Secondary 4 Study Club and ACS (I) Family Day.

### **Teachers’ Day Lunch**

Teachers are the pillars of the school and role models for our children. To celebrate our teachers and staff, and to bless their tireless hard work PSG supports the school in their planning of the Annual Teachers’ Day Lunch.

### **Secondary 4 Study Club**

Parents contribute afternoon snacks to encourage our O-Level students in their preparation for the preliminary examinations. This simple act of kindness helps to motivate the boys to press on and complete the race to their O-Levels. The PSG also prepares a meaningful gift/encouragement pack for the graduating cohorts.

### **ACS(I) Family Day** 

This is a day of bonding for the entire school community with games, music performances and food stalls to celebrate the end of semester one. The PSG supports the school by providing sponsorship for the food stalls and helping out at the event.  

The Gratitude & Blessings Sub-Committee would be grateful for all contributions to facilitate the organisation of these events.
