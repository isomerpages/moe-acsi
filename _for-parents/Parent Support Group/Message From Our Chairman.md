### **Message From Our Chairman**

3 January 2023

Dear Parents / Guardians,

Welcome parents to the ACS (Independent) family!

As Chairman of the ACS(I) Parent Support Group, I would like to thank you for choosing ACS(I) to partner with you in bringing up your children.

ACS(I) is founded on Christian principles as embodied in the Life and Teachings of Jesus Christ. Our core purpose is to nurture ACSians to be catalysts for change with Godly values and robust character, equipped and willing to serve and lead in the family, nation and the global community. The school’s motto, “The Best is Yet to Be”, is taken from Robert Browning’s poem. It encourages students to strive for greater heights by reminding them that their best achievements are yet to come. I believe that an understanding of this core purpose and the founding principles will enable us to parent our children better.

The purpose of ACS(I)’s Parent Support Group (PSG) is to promote a collaborative relationship between the school and parents. To this end, we as parents volunteer our time and talent in helping each other in our parenting journey and in student programmes.

I invite you to be part of our PSG community, to join our meaningful events, prayer groups and support of worthy causes. The PSG has a team of dedicated parents serving on the Executive Committee. We are fellow parents working behind the scenes and I am privileged to lead this team of parents who are fun loving, creative but most important of all have a sacrificial heart to serve the school. We hope you would join us as PSG members as we are constantly in search of people with talent and passion to serve the school.

All PSG events seek to foster a shared journey between the school, your children and yourselves. I encourage you to refer to the Orientation schedule for information on the events we have lined up and some important dates for 2023.

Your involvement in your children’s learning journey is pivotal in their growth. Thank you for being involved parents. This is a gift to the school and your children. It will be my delight to see every one of you coming on board as PSG members to help our children to grow into scholars, officers, ladies and gentlemen.

As we start a new year, I am excited by the opportunity to get to know each one of you. I am confident that your son will have a wonderful ACS(I) journey ahead.

To God be the Glory. The Best is Yet to Be!

Sincerely,
