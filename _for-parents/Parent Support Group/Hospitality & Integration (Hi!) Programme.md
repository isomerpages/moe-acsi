_**_“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.”_** _**1 Peter 4:10 NIV**__

Each year, **ACS (Independent)** welcomes about 50 overseas scholars from countries in the region such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia to join the school.

The Parent Support Group, in conjunction with the **ACS (Independent) Boarding School’s Hospitality and Integration (H&I) Committee**, seek to welcome and help these scholars to integrate into our local community by pairing them with host families in the school who can offer them the warmth and hospitality of a Singapore family through our Hosting Programme.

**Hosting Programme**

Under the Hosting Programme, each host family will be matched with two scholars upon their joining the ACS(I) Boarding School. Host families are encouraged to engage the scholars in one or two activities each semester to establish rapport and nurture bonds of friendship. This is **not** a homestay programme but an opportunity for our host families to invite these young gentlemen into their homes for a meal or to join in a simple family outing or activity.

The scholars, with their resilience and ability to overcome the challenges associated with pursuing their dream of a Singapore education, are excellent role models for our children. Hosting also provides an opportunity for our children to learn to be good hosts and develop empathy.  The opportunity for engagement is also culturally enriching for every person involved. Parents that have volunteered for the programme have found it to be rewarding to be able to befriend and be available to a young person who is new to the school and Singapore. At the same time, scholars who may have encountered difficulty initially in adjusting to their new environment after leaving the familiar comforts of home have found the programme very helpful.

**International Boarders’ Night** 

The PSG organises an **International Boarders’ Night** annually (usually in November or December) for host parents and scholars whom they have been paired with to meet one another and to welcome the scholars to the school and the ACS family. The evening’s programme often involves the scholars putting on a short performance and dinner. The casual gathering is a perfect ice breaker for both sides and marks the beginning of a new chapter in the lives of these students.
