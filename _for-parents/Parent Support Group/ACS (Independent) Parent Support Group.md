### WELCOME TO THE ACS (INDEPENDENT) PARENT SUPPORT GROUP

Dear Fellow Parents, 

We warmly invite you to [join](https://forms.office.com/r/LJKB736UdR) the ACS (Independent) PSG, a family of parent volunteers whose mission is to partner the school in providing a holistic education for our sons and daughters. In this site, we showcase some of the initiatives and activities that the PSG organizes and has embarked on over the years. We look forward to your support as we journey with our children through their years in ACS (Independent)! 

The Best is Yet to Be!  

ACS (Independent) PSG Committee
