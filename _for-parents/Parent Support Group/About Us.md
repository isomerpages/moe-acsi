### **Message From Our Chairman**

<p>9 January 2026&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Parents,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the ACS (Independent) family!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad that you are actively supporting your children in their ACS (Independent) journey. Like many of you, I am a parent walking alongside my children through these important years. I am thankful that ACS (Independent) is founded on Christian principles, as embodied in the life, death and teachings of Jesus Christ. These values guide the school in nurturing excellence, strong character, and a heart for service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Parents’ Support Group (PSG) exists to strengthen the partnership between parents and the school. Through our involvement, we support one another in parenting and contribute meaningfully to our children’s school experience. Whether through events, practical help, or prayer and encouragement behind the scenes, every contribution makes a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our involvement also sends a powerful message to our children. When they see parents giving time and energy in service to the school, they learn the importance of commitment, generosity, and serving others. In this way, we are not only supporting school programmes, but also modelling values that we hope our children will carry with them beyond their years at ACS (Independent).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PSG’s work is centred on two key areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is prayer, which undergirds the life of the school, as we pray for and support its leadership, staff, students and families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is service in action, expressed through events and initiatives that reflect Christ’s love in practical ways. In all that we do, we seek to serve with sincerity and purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I warmly invite you to be part of the PSG community — to join our activities, prayer groups, and connect with fellow parents as we journey together in supporting our children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to getting to know you and serving together in the years ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To God be the glory. The Best Is Yet to Be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aaron Goh&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chairman of the Parent Support Group&nbsp;<br>
