### **Message From Our Chairman**

9 January 2025

Welcome, parents, to the ACS (Independent) family!

I am glad that you are actively supporting your children in their journey.

I’m reminded of the excitement and anticipation I felt when my son first joined ACS(I). It’s a journey that has not only shaped him academically, but has also instilled in him the values that make our school a caring and vibrant community. I am most appreciative that ACS(I) is founded on Christian principles, as embodied in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. With these values, it produces generations of fine ladies and gentlemen who serve and lead in the family, nation, and the global community. The school’s motto, “The Best is Yet to Be,” encourages students to strive for greater heights by reminding them that their best achievements are yet to come. I believe that understanding the school’s values and motto enables us to parent our children better on this journey.

The purpose of ACS(I)’s Parent Support Group (PSG) is to promote a collaborative relationship between the school and parents. To this end, we, as parents, volunteer our time and talent in helping each other in our parenting journey and in our children’s ACS(I) adventure.

I invite you to be part of our PSG community, to join our events, prayer groups, and support worthy causes. The PSG has a team of dedicated parents serving on the Executive Committee. We are fellow parents who are fun-loving, creative, but most of all, have a heart to serve the school.

Your involvement in your children’s learning journey is pivotal to their growth. This is a gift to the school and your children. It will be my delight to see every one of you coming on board to help our children grow into scholars, officers, ladies, and gentlemen.

I am excited by the opportunity to get to know each one of you. I am confident that your sons and daughters will have a wonderful ACS(I) journey ahead.

To God be the Glory. The Best is Yet to Be!

Sincerely,
