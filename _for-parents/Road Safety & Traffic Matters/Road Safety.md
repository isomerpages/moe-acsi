<p><strong>Use of&nbsp;Bicycles, Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) and Power-assisted Bicycles (PABs)</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cycling is a lifestyle choice and is
not encouraged as a mode of transport to and from schools for students.
Students are not allowed to travel to school on bicycles, personal mobility
devices (PMDs) and power-assisted bicycles (PABs).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not allowed to use or park
their bicycles, PMDs and PABs within the school premises.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Active Mobility Act (AMA) contains
a set of rules and code of conduct for cyclists, and riders of PMDs and
PABs. Please refer to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/rules-and-code-of-conduct.html</a>&nbsp;for
more details.</p>
<p><strong>Student Road Safety</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should refrain from using mobile
phones and/or other electronic audio devices while walking.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must always use pedestrian crossings&nbsp;such
as overhead bridges, zebra crossings, underpasses and traffic signal lights
when crossing roads.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be alert for inattentive
drivers even at signalised crossings.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should use footpaths and other
walkways whenever possible and not walk on roads.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not cross at road bends, as the field
of vision will be limited. Students will not be able to see oncoming vehicles,
and drivers, likewise, will not be able to see them.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not cross in front of a stationary
vehicle and in between stationary vehicles.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not sprint across the roads.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not play or stand in the bus bay.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always wait for the bus to stop completely
when boarding or alighting from a bus. &nbsp;Be alert for oncoming traffic
when stepping out of a vehicle.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When walking in a group, walk in a single
file, always facing oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be seen and be safe. &nbsp;Use light-coloured
clothing when walking at night, or carry some reflective materials so drivers
can see you from a distance.&nbsp;</p>
