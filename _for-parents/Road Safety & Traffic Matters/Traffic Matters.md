<p><strong>SAFETY AND SECURITY MEASURES</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school’s commitment to maintaining a safer and more secure
school environment, we have various measures in place to manage vehicular
and pedestrian traffic, as well as protocols to enhance visitor security.</p>
<p>The following are the specific measures currently in place.</p>
<p><strong>PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC FLOW</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the high
footfall within the school, pedestrian pathways are segregated from vehicle
routes during peak hours. This is to minimise the occurrence of accidents
and ensure that everyone can move safely within the school grounds.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create a safer environment
for staff, students and the public at the Main Gate pedestrian crossing,
we will only permit cars driving into the school to exit via the Basketball
Court Gate during peak hours.</p>

</div>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note the following access
and exit points within the school and the peak hours:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Road%20Safety%20&amp;%20Traffic%20matters/Picture2.png">
</div>
<p>^Please exit only via Basketball Court Gate during these hours.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the hours listed
above, exit via the Main Gate will be denied. All cars will be directed
to the Basketball Court Gate when leaving the school. Do note that the
Basketball Court Gate exit is a left turn only into Dover Road.</p>

<p><strong>STUDENT PICK-UP/ DROP-OFF POINT</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick-up/ drop-off point
for students will be at the round-about during peak hours.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Road%20Safety%20&amp;%20Traffic%20matters/Picture4.png">
</div>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents/ Guardians
are reminded not to park or wait for their children at the round-about,
as it is a one-lane road. Instead, please wait to pick your child up until
after dismissal time to ensure he/she is already waiting at the round-about.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The round-about is
closed outside of peak hours. Pick-up and drop-off can only be done in
front of Boarding School Hall 2.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cars leaving the school
outside of peak hours will exit via the Main Gate.</p>
<p><strong>ALTERNATIVE PICK-UP/ DROP-OFF POINTS FOR STUDENTS</strong>
</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During peak hours,
students are usually picked up/dropped off at the round-about. However,
parents are encouraged to use alternative points like the SIT gate or nearby
HDB blocks.</p>
<p><strong>SIT Gate:</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>If your child’s classroom is at the Old Block, the SIT gate drop-off point
is particularly helpful as it is the closest pick-up/ drop-off point to
their classes.</p>
<p>Surrounding <strong>HDB pick-up/ drop-off bay</strong> at:
<br>5 Dover Crescent, Block 5, Singapore 130005</p>

<p><strong>STAFF ONLY BASKETBALL COURT GATE ACCESS</strong>
</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry via the Basketball Court
Gate is only for staff whose vehicle IU units have been registered with
the school’s gantry reader. Entry is <strong>NOT</strong> permitted for other
vehicles.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When exiting the Basketball Court
Gate during peak hours, please be cautious of cars driving into school
as there will be criss-crossing of traffic as shown in the image below:</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certified traffic marshals will
be posted at this access point. For the safety of all drivers entering
and exiting through this access point, please follow the direction of these
traffic marshals.</p>
<p><strong>VISITORS’ PARKING</strong>
</p>
<p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All parking lots at the Boarding
School are out of bounds. Visitors can park at the carpark opposite the
synthetic turf, marked out in red in the diagram below.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Road%20Safety%20&amp;%20Traffic%20matters/Picture10.png">
</div>
<p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A carpark display counter along
the road will indicate whether any lots are available. If the carpark is
full during off peak hours, the gantry will not open and cars will have
to exit the school. Refer to the diagram below for the locations of the
carpark display counter and gantry.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Road%20Safety%20&amp;%20Traffic%20matters/Capture.jpg">
</div>
<p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that there are only
36 lots available in this visitors’ carpark.</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the carpark is full, visitors
will have to park at the Multi-Storey Carpark at Block 28 Dover Crescent
Singapore 120028, opposite the school.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For safety and security reasons, <strong>drivers are not allowed to park indiscriminately within school premises</strong>.
Vehicles that do not comply with the school’s parking regulations will
have their license plates noted by security for follow-up action.</p>
<p><strong>MAIN GATE SECURITY PROCESS FOR INVITED GUESTS</strong>
</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While visitors can only park at
the visitors’ carpark mentioned above, the school can reserve a lot for
invited visitors. These lots are located directly opposite the Boarding
School, as shown in the figure marked in red.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%" height="auto" width="50%" alt="" src="/images/Road Safety &amp; Traffic matters/Picture11.png">
</div>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have been invited to visit
the school, our school staff will ask for the following details so that
a visitor parking lot can be reserved for you in front of the Boarding
School:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date and time of visit</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name(s) of guest(s)</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Car plate number</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Invited guests must present a
valid invitation email from ACS(I) to security personnel. Additionally,
our staff will inform security of your car plate number to reserve a parking
spot in front of the Boarding School.</p>
<p><strong>VISITOR IDENTIFICATION</strong>
</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All visitors must be cleared by
security before they are allowed into the school. They will be given a
sticker that needs to be adhered visibly on their clothing while in the
school premises. Example:</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For visitors with no prior appointment
made with the school, they can park at the visitors’ carpark (if there
are available lots).</p>
<p><strong>CONSIDERATION FOR SCHOOL SECURITY STAFF</strong>
</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our security personnel play a
vital role in ensuring the enforcement of these measures. We kindly request
the support of all stakeholders to cooperate with them, enabling them to
perform their duties effectively. This includes guidance regarding parking,
driving directions within the school, and the necessity for guests to register
and comply with visitor requirements.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a school family, we appreciate
them for their work and ask that they are treated with the necessary respect
at all times.</p>
<p>We seek your continued support and cooperation in enforcing our regulations
to minimise risks and ensure the safety and security of our staff and students.</p>
<p>We appreciate your partnership in keeping our school community safe and
thriving.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
