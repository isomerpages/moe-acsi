Throughout the year, please be reminded to update the school when there is a change in contact details and/or other family-related matters. This is to ensure timely and accurate parent-school communications, especially in the event of an emergency.

Any change(s) should be communicated in writing to the school through his / her Pastoral Care Tutor (PCT) as soon as possible.

You would also need to update your child / ward's details via the Student Details Form (SDF).

**Instructions for updating via the Student Details Form (SDF)**

1.  Visit the SDF portal ([https://pg.moe.edu.sg/forms/sdf](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/forms/sdf)) and log in using your Singpass account
2.  From the portal’s review page, click ‘Edit’ to update details
3.  Click ‘Submit’ to save changes
4.  Close and log out.

Should you need to update any information that is not reflected in the SDF portal, please contact our school’s IT support at [helpdesk@acsindep.edu.sg](mailto:helpdesk@acsindep.edu.sg). For overseas students, the appointed local guardian or caregiver for them will use the appropriate channel to update their medical records.
