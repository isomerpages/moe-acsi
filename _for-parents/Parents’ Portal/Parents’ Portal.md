The [**Parents’ Portal**](https://lms.acsindep.edu.sg/ACSIndep/login.aspx) provides resources and students record modules. The PP allows parents to

*   make appointments for Parent-Teacher Meetings
*   view your child’s term reports, subject teachers list and CCA records
*   view Parents Resources such as Exam/Common Test timetable, Circulars and Principal presentations.

Please refer to the user guide for help : **[\[Instructions to Access ACS (Independent) Parents’ Portal\]](/files/instructions%20to%20access%20acs%20(indep)%20parents%20portal_v7.pdf)**

Queries on the Parents’ Portal should be directed to the IT helpdesk ([helpdesk@acsindep.edu.sg](mailto:helpdesk@acsindep.edu.sg).)

With effect from 2020, circulars, consent forms and other school announcements will be sent through the **Parents Gateway** (PG) mobile app ([https://pg.moe.edu.sg/](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/)).

Parents are reminded to download the PG app (available on iOS and Android platforms) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process.
