<p><strong>Road Safety and Traffic Matters</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Entry / Exit Points</strong>
</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vehicles should enter the
school through the Main Gate along Dover Road. The side gate (Gate 2) is
for staff entry only.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exiting vehicles may use
the school’s Main Gate and Gate 2. The school’s Main Gate is open from
5.00 am to 11.00 pm on Mondays to Sundays.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exiting Vehicles via the
Main gate are advised to turn&nbsp;<strong>right</strong>, especially during
peak hours.</p>
<p><strong>Pick-up and Drop-Off: Roundabout &amp; Access Hours</strong>
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pick-up and drop-off
point for parents/guardians to pick up and drop off students is at the
roundabout at Level 1.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pick-up point within
the school for taxis and Private Hire Vehicles (PHVs) is at the zebra crossing
under the ramp. Passengers should promptly and safely board the vehicle
when it arrives, as there is no waiting area for the vehicle.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that the traffic
flow in and out of the school is&nbsp;<strong>single lane</strong>. As
such, vehicle access is limited to pick-up and drop-off only. No parking
or waiting is allowed along the roads or at the roundabout.</p>
<p><strong>Parking</strong>
</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents and visitors should
use the Visitor’s carpark opposite the artificial turf. All carpark lots
beyond those in the Visitor’s carpark are reserved for staff.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Visitor’s Carpark is
strictly for visitors. It is not to be used by student drivers.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternative parking is available
at the multi-storey carpark at&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ru7g3MjXRuD2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Block 28 Dover Crescent Singapore 130028</a>,
located opposite the school.</p>
<p><strong>Official Appointments /Access</strong>
</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents / Guardians who have made appointments
with the school should park at the Visitor’s carpark and proceed to the
security guard post for check-in before proceeding to the General Office.
Do note that only registered or pre-cleared vehicles will be allowed to
park within the school compound, subject to the availability of car park
lots.</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to the space frame is only for
pre-arranged vehicles. There is strictly no vehicular access during morning
assembly.</p>
<p>12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pedestrians must observe safety rules
when crossing at traffic junctions and/or pedestrian crossings.</p>
<p><strong>Use of&nbsp;Bicycles, Personal Mobility Devices (PMDs) and Power-assisted Bicycles (PABs)</strong>
</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cycling is a lifestyle choice and is
not encouraged as a mode of transport to and from schools for students.
Students are not allowed to travel to school on bicycles, personal mobility
devices (PMDs) and power-assisted bicycles (PABs).</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are not allowed to use or
park their bicycles, PMDs and PABs within the school premises.</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Active Mobility Act (AMA) contains
a set of rules and code of conduct for cyclists, and riders of PMDs and
PABs. Please refer to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/walk-cycle-ride/rules-and-code-of-conduct.html</a> for

<p><strong>Student Road Safety</strong>
</p>
<p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should refrain from using
mobile phones and/or other electronic audio devices while walking.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must always use pedestrian
crossings&nbsp;such as overhead bridges, zebra crossings, underpasses and
traffic signal lights when crossing roads.</p>
<p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students must be alert for inattentive
drivers even at signalised crossings.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students should use footpaths
and other walkways whenever possible and not walk on roads.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not cross at road bends, as
the field of vision will be limited. Students will not be able to see oncoming
vehicles, and drivers, likewise, will not be able to see them.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not cross in front of a stationary
vehicle and in between stationary vehicles.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not sprint across the roads.</p>
<p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not play or stand in the bus
bay.</p>
<p>24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always wait for the bus to stop
completely when boarding or alighting from a bus. &nbsp;Be alert for oncoming
traffic when stepping out of a vehicle.</p>
<p>25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When walking in a group, walk
in a single file, always facing oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be seen and be safe. &nbsp;Use
light-coloured clothing when walking at night, or carry some reflective
materials so drivers can see you from a distance.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>
