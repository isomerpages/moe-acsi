IB Diploma Programme students are required to undertake original research and write an extended essay of 4,000 words (maximum).This essay offers the student the opportunity to investigate a topic of special interest and to become acquainted with the kind of independent research and writing skills expected at the university level. The IBO recommends that a student devote a total of about 40 hours of private study and writing time to the essay. The extended essay can serve to deepen a studentâ€™s programme of study, for example when the student chooses to focus the essay on a topic included in a higher-level course.
