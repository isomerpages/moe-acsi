**Biology Research in ACS Independent**

Over the years, our teachers in the department have been actively promoting biological research among the student population. Students from Year 2 onwards are encouraged to take on biology research as part of their Individualized Study Option (ISO). These students usually continue with their research work till they are in their Year 6, allowing time to hone their research and presentation skills.

**Our Biology Laboratories**

Our biology laboratories are well equipped to handle the studentsâ€™ research projects and we are constantly looking for ways to upgrade our laboratories. Currently, we have a total of 8 different laboratories, each dedicated to specific areas of biological research or studies.

**Areas of Focus**

Our research focus is wide ranging depending on the amplitude and interest of our students. Each project is purely student-driven and mentored by our own teachers. The areas of research include (but not limiting to):

\-Ecology   
\-Environmental related research  
\-Microbial research   
\-Plant culture   
\-Organic extraction
