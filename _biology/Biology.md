The Biology Department seeks to imbue students to embrace the workings of, and comprehend interrelationships among, living systems. It is the departmentâ€™s goal that students graduate from our school with a judicious understanding of the evolution of life encompassed by its unity and variety and further coupled with an astute recognition of the importance of the preservation of biological diversity. The Biology Department is also committed to helping students to pursue rewarding careers in biology and related disciplines. We hope that students will use their abilities and training to promote the growth of biological knowledge and its application for the benefit of the environment systems and societies.
