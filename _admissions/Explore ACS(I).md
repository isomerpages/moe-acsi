**Explore ACS(I) from Home**

While our campus is currently closed to visitors, you can still explore our school, and learn more about everyday life at ACS(I).

**“Our ACS Forever” Video**

This film, shot by our Year 5 student Hanson Lu, offers a glimpse into our beloved ACS (Independent) campus that we call HOME. The school campus is captured as the primary subject in this work, and it was filmed during COVID-19. Year 5 student Collier Ow, inspired by the ACS Anthem, wrote an original composition and it forms the motif and aural background in this first-ever aerial feature of the school.
