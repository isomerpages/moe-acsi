**2022 JAE (Joint Admission Exercise) Appeal**

Students who wish to appeal for admission into 2022 IBDP after the release of the Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) posting may do so from 8 am on Friday, 4 February 2022 to 12 pm on Thursday, 10 February 2022 online. There is no need to come in person.

Please take note that there are very limited places available for admission through JAE appeal and admission will be based on merit.

DSA-JC students are not eligible to participate in the JAE appeal exercise as they will not be considered for transfer unless there are extenuating circumstances.

Students who wish to appeal for a place must meet the L1R5 cut-off point to be considered.

To submit your appeal, please click [**here**](https://site1.acsindep.edu.sg/Appls/Y5AdmissionAppeal/AppealForm.aspx).

**Successful appeal applicants will be contacted via telephone by Thursday, 10 February 2022, 5 pm.**
