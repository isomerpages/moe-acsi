**Who are we?**

Anglo-Chinese School Independent Stage (ACSIS) is the senior division of the ACS Drama Club and is made up of Year 5 and 6 students from the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The club was formed in 2006 by a group of students who were deeply passionate about drama and wanted to continue pursuing this interest in the IBDP years. As all IBDP students need to produce a reflective portfolio on Creativity Activity and Service activities, ACSIS was formed with the objective of helping students to achieve this outcome, while engaging in meaningful dramatic endeavours. The inaugural performance of ACSIS in 2007, featuring Peter Shaffer’s&nbsp;_Black Comedy_&nbsp;was a great success, well-received by the audience and effective in fund-raising for the school. This proved to be just the first of many outstanding productions for the stage – the most recent being the club’s acclaimed thought-provoking double-bill of Kuo Pao Kun’s&nbsp;_No Parking on Odd Days_&nbsp;and Sabrina Mahfouz’s&nbsp;_A Shop Selling Speech_&nbsp;in July 2019.

And in 2020 – 2022, when circumstances prevented us from taking to the stage to perform, we found new ways of performing in an on-line context, including:

“As Singapore prepared to hunker down for the Covid-19 circuit breaker, The Sunday Times invited local writers to respond to the pandemic in words that could lift the spirits, serve as a sobering reminder or form a rallying cry. It received submissions from nearly 500 writers and publishe\[d\] the top 10 entries” on April 19th 2020 ([https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/words-to-lift-spirits](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/words-to-lift-spirits)). In this montage of heartfelt performances, actors from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Stage give voice to the full range of familiar local characters depicted in these 10 timely poems. We hope you will be moved to laughter and tears by the heart-warming idiosyncrasies, sense of duty and sense of humour that characterise the sometimes flawed but always loved community that is our Singapore.
