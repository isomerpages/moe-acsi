**ACSI Stage**

Anglo-Chinese School Independent Stage is the school's IB drama CCA and is made up of Year 5 and 6 students from the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The club's inaugural performance in 2007 of Peter Shafferâ€™s _Black Comedy_ proved to be just the first of many outstanding productions, which range widely in genre and provenance and emphasise literary merit and the aesthetics of language. These include Shakespeare's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_, Kuo Pau Kun's _No Parking On Odd Days_&nbsp;(reworked for an ensemble cast) and David Calcutt's _Salem_&nbsp;(a youth version of _the Crucible_) among many others.

In 2023, the club produced ACS(I)'s first ever _Shakespeare in the Park_&nbsp;in the school's outdoor amphitheatre, a full-length performance of _As You Like It_ in the original language. This was quickly followed in April 2024 with a premiere of our student playwright Zackary Chong's full length play about the role of art and friendship in Singapore's national identity, _How to Sell Your Art from the Grave_, which also featured original works by IB Art students.         

In July 2025, Stage then presented a run of four performances of our Year 6 IB students' set text Henrik Ibsen's classic play A Doll's House, featuring two different casts over 3 days.

As their 2025 Performing Arts Night Festival offering, Stage presents a whimsical and thought-provoking original short form piece by student playwright Lucas Tan, featuring references to modernist and absurdist theatre in a familiar local setting. This is closely followed by a two night run of our IB Language and Literature set text, the classic Ancient Greek tragedy Euripides' Medea, in which we make use of masks, sets and an outdoor amphitheatre performance setting to recreate the magic of the ancient art form.

To share their love of drama with the wider community, the club also conducts yearly VIA performances and workshops for primary school students in November.

Singapore versus Covid: The Show Must Go On

In 2020-2022, when circumstances from taking to the stage, the club found many new ways of performing in an online context. This includes the following montage of heartfelt performances of local poetry reflecting on the collective experience of the pandemic. We hope you enjoy the show!
