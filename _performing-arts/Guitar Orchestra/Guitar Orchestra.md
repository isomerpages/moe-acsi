The ACS (I) Guitar Orchestra is a full-fledged Niibori orchestra, comprising of the Alto Cembalo, Alto, Prime, Prime Cembalo, Bass, Contrabass and Guitarron. Over the past year, our talented 80-member strong orchestra had performed for a variety of events both on and off campus. With our wide repertoire ranging from major classical works to jazz and even contemporary music, we perform at major school events including Festival of Arts and Honors Day; and at a variety of off-campus venues, including guitar festivals and other public school performances.

Additionally, the Guitar Orchestra has performed well in various competitions and performances.  Both the Secondary and the IB section of the Guitar Orchestra have obtained Certificates of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for numerous successive years.

Besides just achievements, the Guitar Orchestra has provided members with invaluable exposure and experience. The orchestra has been improving itself musically and technically through a series of master classes by renowned professional guitarists. Furthermore, the myriad of activities such as annual camps and many other member-organised outings such as Action Day, the orchestra has indeed bonded the students as one cohesive family.

In all, the students have indeed scaled to greater heights as an Orchestra with their respective Student Presidents—Chiew Mun Fung Ivan of 6.02, and Tang Chung En of 4.05 in charge of the orchestra. This success can also be attributed to a team of devoted committee members who carry out their duties with great passion and a heart of service. Currently, Ms Sherilyn Khng leads the orchestra as the teacher-in-charge, along with Mr Benjamin Yeo, Mr Cao Hui Zhong and Mr Loy Xing Jian. We currently have 3 conductors cum instructors in the orchestra: Mr Balraj Gopal, Mr Ang Dun Hao and Mr Leslie Danker.
