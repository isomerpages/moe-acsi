The ACS (I) Guitar Orchestra is a full-fledged Niibori orchestra, featuring the Alto Cembalo, Alto, Prime, Prime Cembalo, Bass, Contrabass, and Guitarron. With a talented 80-member ensemble, we have performed at a variety of events both on and off campus over the past year. Our diverse repertoire spans major classical works, jazz, and contemporary music, showcased at key school events such as the Festival of Arts and Honors Day.

Beyond performances, the Guitar Orchestra has consistently excelled in competitions. Both the Secondary and IB sections have earned Certificates of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for numerous successive years, reflecting our musical excellence.

The orchestra not only hones musical and technical skills but also fosters camaraderie. Members benefit from master classes led by renowned professional guitarists and engage in enriching activities such as annual camps and internal concerts, strengthening our bond as a close-knit community.

This growth and success are guided by dedicated student leaders, including Student Presidents Declan Keh (6.08) and Kuan Junheng, Jayden (4.10), supported by a passionate committee committed to service. The orchestra is under the stewardship of Ms. Sherilyn Khng (teacher-in-charge), alongside Mr. Benjamin Yeo, Ms. Jacqueline Liew, Ms. Krystal Lee, Mr. Loy Xing Jian, and Ms. Yu See Yee. Our four conductors and instructors—Mr. Balraj Gopal, Mr. Ang Dun Hao, Mr. Leslie Danker, and Mr. Tan Han Siang—play a crucial role in shaping our musical journey.

Together, we continue to push boundaries, striving for musical excellence and unity as an orchestra.
