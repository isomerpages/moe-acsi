### ACS Drama Club (ACSDC)

The Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Drama Club (ACSDC) allows Secondary 1-4 students who have an interest in theatre and drama to practise and showcase their talents to the school. Members are not only trained to explore acting as a form of art but also provided with an all-rounded learning experience and appreciation for the theatre. Besides acting, club members perform a diverse range of tasks; from working on sets for performances to creation and design of costumes, as well as lighting and sound design. This has allowed students to specialise and hone in specific aspects of theatre, while having an all-rounded theatre experience, and ultimately allows one to develop essential life skills such as confidence, improvisation, effective language and communication and emotional intelligence through warm-up exercises, bonding games and various other activities.

ACSDC participates in the Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging of Drama (SYF) biannually and has consistently been doing outstandingly well. In the last 2 SYF competitions, ACSDC attained a Distinction Award for their performance of _The Carnival_ in 2019 and _Dear Jacob_ in 2021. During the SYF year, the club also performs its SYF piece during the school’s Performing Arts Night Festival to enable the school to enjoy their production.

In addition to the SYF competitions, ACSDC also performs during the school’s biennial Festival of Arts, providing students with opportunities to sing. In 2020, the ACS(I) Choir and ACSDC forged a partnership once again, this time to perform a musical entitled _Newsies_. Collaborations with other schools are also held frequently. In the same year, ACSDC collaborated with Deyi Secondary School for SYFgoesOnline! to produce 2 featured short monologues. The Drama Club also gives its members a chance to hone their scriptwriting and directing skills through _Assortments,_ an informal free performance put up annually, which is enjoyed by family and friends of club members since its inception in 2010.

ACSDC has always been and will continue to be a source of entertainment for the ACS (Independent) student body, adding colour and flavour to the school life of each individual through the artistic talent of all its club members.
