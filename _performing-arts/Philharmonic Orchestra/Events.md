The Orchestra provides its members with many invaluable opportunities to perform over the course of the year. Several key events we participate in include:

##### Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation

The SYF Arts Presentation is a biennial national event for the various performing arts groups in Singapore to showcase their talents and passion for music. The Secondary Orchestra has made its mark in the local music scene by clinching consecutive pinnacle awards (Gold with Honours / Gold / Distinction) over the last two decades, while the IB Orchestra, which was formed only in recent years, achieved a Distinction at the 2017, 2019,  2021, 2021 and 2023 SYF Arts Presentation.

#### Festival Of Arts & Performing Arts Night Festival

Held shortly after the SYF Arts presentation, the Performing Arts Night Festival allows the orchestra to showcase our SYF repertoire alongside other Performing Arts CCAs.

The Festival of Arts (FOA), on the other hand, sees each Performing Arts CCA putting up individual evening concert during non-SYF years with our Orchestra’s FOA typically taking place in April or May. We perform music from different periods and genres (including works by alumni), many of which allows our members to explore challenging pieces.

#### Collaborative Events

_With School Orchestras_

Organised by the student committees of both schools in a collaborative effort, collaborative exchanges serve to expose different orchestras with one another. It is usually a day of fun and intensive rehearsals, eventually leading up to a combined performance, giving both orchestras the opportunity to showcase how they have grown and learnt together.

For the year 2017, the Secondary Orchestra organised their first exchange with the TKGS String ensemble and the IB Orchestra organised their first exchange with the ACJC String ensemble. It was certainly a memorable experience for both orchestras!

_With Orchestra of the Music Makers (OMM)  
_

Since 2018, the Philharmonic Orchestra has had close ties with OMM. ACS hosts an annual, meaningful collaboration with OMM and their conductor, the esteemed Prof. Chan Tze Law. 2018 saw the musicians come together to form a large string orchestra and explore different sound worlds together, and in 2019, the event involved winds, brasses and percussion as they rehearsed Tchaikovksy’s Symphony No. 5 and Elgar’s Nimrod Variations. Students also support OMM musicians at concerts. ACPO looks forward to more events with OMM, which has provided a significant number of our alumni with invaluable opportunities to continue contributing to Singapore’s music scene even after graduation.

#### Founders’ Day, Methodist Staff School’s Get-Together, Chinese New Year

The Philharmonic Orchestra performs in the school’s Founders’ Day, Methodist Staff School’s Get-Together and Chinese New Year services yearly. We serve the school fervently by playing both classical pieces as well as accompanying music to traditional hymns/pieces.

#### Year 1 Performing Arts Showcase

Held at the start of each academic year, the Year 1 Performing Arts showcase aims to introduce our new Year 1 students to the various Performing Arts CCAs in the school. During this event, the orchestra performs a variety of both classical and popular pieces that demonstrate its competency. After the showcase, applicants interested in joining or finding out more about the orchestra can look for us at our CCA booth.

#### Open House

The open house is a yearly event where interested students and parents may visit the school to find out more about ACS (Independent)’s academic programmes and CCAs. The orchestra showcases various classical and contemporary pieces. Do look for us at our CCA booth should you have any questions about our orchestra!

#### Outreach

The orchestra students have a huge heart of service and find numerous ways to serve the wider community. Since 2017, the IB Orchestra has done a music outreach assembly programme at Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School. Students from the orchestra also volunteer to perform for elderly guests from the Dover community during the Chinese New Year lunch hosted by the school.

Students who wish to plan adhoc music outreach projects and events are given guidance and support.
