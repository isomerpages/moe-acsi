The Philharmonic Orchestra provides the following opportunities to members:

**MEP-Philharmonic Orchestra String Scholarship**

*   Viola (for existing violinists only)
*   Cello (for non-string players)
*   Double Bass (for non-string players)

Year 1 Music Elective Programme (MEP) students with excellent aural skills and attitude may be offered scholarships of a 4-year tenure, subject to renewal each year. Students with violin background will be offered a scholarship to learn the viola. Students who learn the piano and have no second instrument will be offered a scholarship to learn the cello or double bass as a beginner.        

Under this scholarship, students will receive fully subsidised lessons under an esteemed tutor (tutor information available [here](https://staging.d270c0tj2w26u.amplifyapp.com/philharmonic/conductors-and-tutors/)), for up to 30h of tuition

Lessons are conducted in school. Cellists and double bassists will be loaned an instrument for use in school and CCA rehearsals. They are encouraged to purchase their own instrument for home practice.

All our scholars have an excellent track record at the ABRSM Examinations, with many achieving high Distinctions. Violists typically complete Grade 8 by Year 4, while cellists and double bassists usually graduate with at least a Grade 6. Students under the scholarship receive plenty of performance opportunities and many opt to use this second instrument for MEP Performance examinations. A significant number further their study of the instrument at junior college and even university levels.
