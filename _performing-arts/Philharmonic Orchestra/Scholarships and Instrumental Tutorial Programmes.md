The Philharmonic Orchestra provides the following opportunities to members:

**1) MEP-Philharmonic Orchestra String Scholarship**

*   Viola (for existing violinists only)
*   Cello (for non-string players)
*   Double Bass (for non-string players)

Year 1 Music Elective Programme (MEP) students with excellent aural skills and attitude may be offered scholarships of a 4-year tenure, subject to renewal each year. Students with violin background will be offered a scholarship to learn the viola. Students who learn the piano and have no second instrument will be offered a scholarship to learn the cello or double bass as a beginner.

Under this scholarship, students will receive heavily subsidized lessons under an esteemed tutor (tutor information available [here](https://staging.d270c0tj2w26u.amplifyapp.com/philharmonic/conductors-and-tutors/)), paying $900 per year for up to 30h of tuition \[_note: this is an update on 9 Jan 2019 and scholars will now be able to receive 30h of tuition instead of 22h\]._ 

Lessons are conducted in school. Cellists and double bassists are required to purchase their own instrument for home practice but may loan an instrument for use in school and CCA rehearsals.

All our scholars have an excellent track record at the ABRSM Examinations, with many achieving high Distinctions. Violists typically complete Grade 8 by Year 4, while cellists and double bassists usually graduate with at least a Grade 6. Students under the scholarship receive plenty of performance opportunities and many opt to use this second instrument for MEP Performance examinations. A significant number further their study of the instrument at junior college and even university levels.

**2) Viola Experience Course**

All violinists who join the orchestra are required to attend a viola experience course to gain fresh insights and a better understanding of the instrument, including some fundamental techniques. This fully-subsidized course comprises 3-4 group lessons.

Those who develop a keen interest and wish to pursue may continue with the Viola Tutorial Programme (see below).

Violas will be provided.

**3) Viola Tutorial Programme**

From 2019, Year 1 to 2 students who have undergone the viola experience course and are keen to continue lessons may join this programme. Students will receive partially subsidized lessons and may sign up in pairs if of similar standards. Lessons will be conducted in school and instruments will be on loan to students.

_note: all students are required to submit a $200 deposit for instruments on loan from the school. The deposit will be forfeited and additional charges may be incurred if the instruments are damaged or lost. The deposit will be refunded upon return of instrument (in good condition)._
