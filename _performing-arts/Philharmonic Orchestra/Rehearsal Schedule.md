*   All emails to be sent at least 1 day in advance
*   Failure to inform teachers promptly may result in being marked absent
*   Attach relevant documentation to the email
*   Students are still required to email ACPO teachers if they are attending other school / CCA activities. ACPO teachers may require an excuse email from other activities’ teacher ICs.
*   Students are also required to inform ACPO teachers if they are arriving late / leaving early. This is to ensure attendance is marked accurately
*   Apart from (official) MC cases, under no circumstance may any student assume he / she is excused from rehearsals.
*   Parents’ letter/email will be accepted twice a term only

Thanks!
