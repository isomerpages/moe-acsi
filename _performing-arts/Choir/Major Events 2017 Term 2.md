To be honest, I have never had any experience in choir before. As a new student to the school, I have many CCA options to choose from; however, I decided to choose choir because I want to challenge myself to do something totally different from what I usually do.

In my first choir practice, we were told about the Singapore Youth Festival Performance that our choir going to participate and that we only have less than 4 months to prepare for it. I did not feel much stress in term 1 because there wasn’t much schoolwork to do and the demands in choir was very manageable for me. However, as Mid-Year Exams approaching, schoolwork getting more stressful and I got sick frequently which affected much of my performance in the choir. I was thinking of dropping SYF to focus more on my studies. However, our choir conductor and teachers gave me a lot of support and motivation to carry on. Not to mention the understanding and encouraging that I got from my fellow choir members although I knew that I had frequently letting them down for the mistakes that I made during practices.

I am really glad that I persevered. In the actual SYFP, I can really fell that adrenaline went rushing down my veins as we sang our second song, Bushes and Briars. I would have never experienced it if I quit half way. I truly felt happy and a sense of achievement as we have overcome one of our biggest challenges yet as a family. I will always treasure this experience for what I have learned along the journey.

Even though I have only joined for five months, I am so surprised and fascinated by how much the choir has to offer to newcomers, especially foreign scholars like me. It was beyond my expectation how much we achieved and how well-organized every event we took part in this past semester. We got to watch a world-famous choir at a humongous concert hall, collaborated with our seniors from Vocal ACcord to performance a mini musical at the Founder’s Day Service, put on quite a marvelous show at Esplanade Concourse, to name a few, and as wild as it got, we even recorded our tracks at an established studio! Nonetheless, the best part was our wondrous performance at SOTA for SYFP. It was the fruit of months of restless training and perfecting our singing to the very bits. With all dedication and efforts, we learnt to suppress our stage fright, to break through our self-imposed limits, and to put up one performance after another as one unity. It was hard. But in the process, we learnt that there was no shortcut to perfection, we kept on trying and thriving nonstop because we knew ‘we have that sound’; like Mr. Low our instructor would encourage us. SYFP was not a mere competition to me, it became our unanimous goal that pulled all of us in choir closer together. It taught me to believe in the power of a family, be it in choir, or in class, or even in school. Unity can do magic, it needs not be spoken aloud, it just needs to be believed in. Because on the stage, all is heard is our voice, and the applause.
