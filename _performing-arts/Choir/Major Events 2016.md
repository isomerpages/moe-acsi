2016 is a busy and yet fulfilling year for us. We have performed for events such as:

We organized our first choral exchange in November 2016. It was a joint event with the choirs from Anderson Secondary School, Hwa Chong Institution, St Margaret’s Secondary School and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School and we closed the three-day event with a concert titled “5upernova”. During the three days, choristers from the participating schools worked as one united choir to learn, sing and perform together while friendships were forged and memories were treasured.

It was an extremely rare opportunity for us to experience the different teaching and conducting styles of four very experienced conductors from the participating choirs: Mr Low Xu Hao, Mr Yong Chee Foon, Ms Choy Siew Woon, and Ms Dawn Yin Sze-Ling. The stunning performance spoke aloud the effort that all participating members put in.

Organizing event like choral exchange was a very big step for our choir and we are looking forward to have more of such collaborations in the future to learn and sing alongside choristers from other schools.
