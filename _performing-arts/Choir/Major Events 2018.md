It was indeed another memorable choral exchange. We all went away with a very high spirit after the concert.

We would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the following people:

*   Ms Grace Ng, Ms Yu and Dr Tham for overseeing the planning and execution of the event, Mr Low for liaising with the schools conductor,
*   Teachers from all participating schools, to agree to take part and to be there to take care of their school choir,
*   The conductors, to orchestrate the rehearsals and performance,
*   Mr Koh from PRSS, to manager the backstage,
*   Mr Andrew Yong, for the support of his MR team,
*   Estate Office, for logistical assistance,
*   All of our Year 4 seniors who came back help up,
*   Harry Wang, for documenting the performance,
*   Everyone who had contributed your help, one way or another, that ensured the smooth running of the three days event.

Last but not least, Mrs Chen Yi Fang who oversees the Performing Arts Groups and our Senior Admin for their unwavering support, as without them, we would not have such a meaningful and memorable event.

Even though the performance, Supernova, had unavoidably become the highlight of the exchange; however, it did not steal away the objectives of the exchange, i.e. to give us students a platform to interact and to showcase our talents. We believe those are the main purposes for us to organize and for participating schools to take part in the event. This was the third time our school holding the exchange and, as usual, it’s a very fruitful learning experience for our choir committee and members in planning and running the event. I believe it is time for us to move on to try out new endeavours and hopefully there will be some other school to take over the baton from next year onward.
