<p>As a choir, we strive to share the beauty of music with others. Our aim
is simple: to inspire others with our voices.</p>
<p>Our experience as choir members is always a colourful and fulfilling one.
We practise hard and perform regularly throughout the year, both on and
off campus. Performing at major school events, such as the Founderâ€™s Day
Service and National Day Celebration, alongside our seniors from Vocal
ACcord, has always been, and will continue to be, our sincere way of thanking
the school for its strong support of our choir.</p>
<p>Apart from the Singapore Youth Festival (Arts Presentation), we also look
forward to biennial concerts like Festival of the Arts and Performing Arts
Night. Organising and participating in choral exchanges, as well as performing
at workshops and festivals, are just some of the many ways we grow and
share our experiences with choristers from other schools.</p>
<p>Our repertoire is diverse. In addition to classical choir pieces, we also
perform hymns, Christmas carols, and pop songs. Whether weâ€™re learning
from our experienced conductor, Mr Low Xu Hao, relaxing with our friends
in choir, or going on concert outings with fellow members, the choir will
always be a place filled with music, laughter, friendship, and family.</p>
