Choir music has always been an integral part of the ACSian experience. As a choir, we expose people to the beauty of music. Our aim is simple: to inspire others with our voices.

Our experience as choir members is always a very colourful and fulfilling one. We practice hard and we perform regularly year-round within as well as off campus. Performing for school events like Chinese New Year Celebration, Founderâ€™s Day Service and National Day Celebration has always been and will continue to be our sincere gesture to thanks the school for being so supportive to our choir. Biennial concerts like Festival of the Arts and Performing Arts Night are events that we look forward to because we get to work and perform together with our seniors from Vocal ACcord. Organising or taking part in choral exchange and performing in choral festivals are a couple of the many things that we do to learn and exchange our choral experience with choristers from other schools. Our choir also invite choral masters, like Professor Tommyanto Kandisaputra from Indonesia, to give us advice in choir performance.

We sing many types of songs, other than classical choir pieces, we also have in our repertoire hymns, Christmas carols, and pop songs. To enrich our choir experience further, we also invited beatbox instructor Charles Wong to conduct a workshop for us in May.

Be it learning from our experienced conductor Mr Low Xu Hao, or just chillaxing with our friends in choir, or going for concert outing with fellow choir members, our choir will always be a great place for music, laughter, friends and family.
