Joining ACS (Independent) Choir has given me lle memories and valuable learning opportunities to better myself. One of the most significant moments in choir for me was the performance at the Voice of Singapore 2017.

The occasion took place in the palatial hall located in the heart of the city, Chijmes. Before the performance, I was overwhelmed by nervosity due to the fact that this was my first performance in a place other than schools. When the time for us to perform came, we stood up and walk steadily to the stage. Mr. Low, the distinguished instructor and brilliant conductor of ours, using his adroit hands to conduct and helped us to give a marvelous performance. After the performance, a relieving loud applause could be heard.

This experience seemed very ordinary. There was neither special twist in the plot nor unique occurrence. However, it was very significant for me as life-changing lesson was learnt within that short period of time. I learnt the importance of teamwork and how to work together with others not only as a choir but as a family. My courage and confidence also took a step to a higher level. We learnt from the mistakes we made and fixed it in the practice afterwards.

I am pretty sure the impact of this event was not only on me but also on the choir as a whole. I am really grateful to be in the choir, otherwise I would not have experienced the many life changing occasions that enable me to be a better person. I would not have met wonderful people who have taught me a lot in terms of solidarity and musicality. For me, this choir is the best choir someone could have joined and we are still trying our best to better ourselves. I believe ACS (Independent) Choir sure lives up to the school motto, “The Best Is Yet To Be”.

### Studiorum with Professor Tommyanto Kandisaputra on Mar 15

From all the past events that I had gone through with the choir, I regarded highly the chance of meeting and learning from Professor Tommyanto in the studiorum on March 15th 2017\. It was a significant moment for me as I was not confident with my voice and vocal techniques. Worst still, the Singapore Youth Festival Performance date was approaching and I might be a burden to the choir.

Professor Tommyanto taught us lots of interesting methods by way of imagination. I recalled one of his techniques called “rainbow” where we must sustain our energy level as a “rainbow” throughout the bar. It was a technique that had already been imparted by Mr. Low during our choir practices; however, Professor Tommyanto illustrated the technique in a different light that it helped us to picture the method more vividly. He also emphasized on using mathematical concept in visualizing the way we project voice: the use of x and y-axis to guide us projecting sound as a good choir. It was useful for me, because through that simulation, I could get the idea of the ideal axis for projecting our voice.

The studiorum with Professor Tommyanto was indeed a remarkable event that contributed much to the development of our vocal techniques. In personal extent, I regarded the opportunity a huge stepping stone for my singing journey in the future.
