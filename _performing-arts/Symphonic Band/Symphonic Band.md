The ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band is an award-winning band with a long, illustrious history in the school. Founded in 1966 as a brass band comprising a modest 18 members, it has since grown into a full symphonic band, with a diverse instrumentation, and a membership of 80 strong budding musicians. Over its long history, the ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band has obtained numerous stellar accolades both locally at the Singapore Youth Festival as well as international platforms, such as the Australian International Music Festival. The Symphonic Band is currently under the baton of Mr Francis Tan, and who is assisted by Ms Sharon Tan.

The ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band provides an environment for learning unlike any other CCAs in the school. Newcomers do not require any prior musical experience to join the Band. Year 1 members are taught basic music theory and instrumental skills and techniques by experienced instrument tutors in the Junior Band. The Symphonic Band, comprising Year 2 – 4 members, and where Junior Band members eventually graduate into, have multiple opportunities throughout the year to hone and to showcase their musical skills. The ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band stages several concerts a year. These range from the school’s Festival of Arts performance, to Band Night, as well as performances at community events and at the Istana. 

Beyond musical proficiency, the Band programme also inculcates important values such as diligence, integrity, resilience and empathy, which would shape members to be exemplary in character. Many leadership opportunities are afforded to Band members, ranging from positions such as Section Leaders, to pinnacle positions such as Drum and Band Majors. In recognition of the rigour and wholesomeness of the Band programme, Symphonic Band members are exempted from having to join a second CCA in the school.

Last but not least, the ACS(I) Band (comprising Symphonic Band and Wind Ensemble) participated in Division 3 of the 2024 Asia Pacific Band Festival in April 2024 and emerged with a score of 85.07%, receiving the Gold with Distinction Award. A few months later, the Symphonic Band, comprising only Year 2-3 members, emerged as the Division 2B Champion Band at the 2024 Singapore International Band Festival, with a score of 90.17%, receiving the Gold with Distinction Award. In both competitions, ACS(I) Band was the only Band to receive the Gold with Distinction Award!
