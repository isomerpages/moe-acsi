The ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band is an award-winning band with a long, illustrious history in the school. Founded in 1966 as a brass band comprising a modest 18 members, it has since grown into a full symphonic band, with a diverse instrumentation, and a membership of 80 strong budding musicians. Over its long history, the ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band has obtained numerous stellar accolades both locally at the Singapore Youth Festival as well as international platforms, such as the Australian International Music Festival. The Symphonic Band is currently under the baton of Mr Francis Tan, who is assisted by Ms Sharon Tan.

The ACS (Independent) Symphonic Band warmly welcomes newcomers without any prior musical experience. Year 1 members are taught basic music theory and instrumental skills by experienced instrument tutors in the Junior Band. The Symphonic Band, comprising Year 2 to 4 members, and where Junior Band members eventually graduate into, stages several concerts a year. These range from the school’s Festival of Arts performances to Band Night, as well as performances at community events, thus providing students with many opportunities to showcase their musical skills.

Beyond musical proficiency, the Band programme also inculcates important values such as diligence, integrity, resilience and empathy, which shape members to be exemplary in character. Multiple leadership opportunities are afforded to Band members, ranging from Section Leader positions to pinnacle positions such as Drum and Band Majors. In recognition of the rigour and wholesomeness of the Band programme, Symphonic Band members are exempted from joining a second CCA.

In 2024, the ACS(I) Band (comprising Symphonic Band and Wind Ensemble) participated in 2024 Asia Pacific Band Festival (Division 3) and emerged with a score of 85.07%, receiving the Gold with Distinction Award. A few months later, the Symphonic Band, comprising only Year 2-3 members, emerged as the Division 2B Champion Band at the 2024 Singapore International Band Festival, with a score of 90.17%, receiving the Gold with Distinction Award. In both competitions, ACS(I) Band was the only Band to receive the Gold with Distinction Award!

In 2025, the Symphonic Band received the Certificate of Distinction at the 2025 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. The ACS(I) Band also had the honour of performing in the Opening Concert of the Asia and Pacific Band Directors’ Association (APBDA) Conference in August 2025, performing as the only local band at its Opening Concert alongside Cyber Symphonic Winds from Hong Kong, and Kanagawa University Symphonic Band from Japan.
