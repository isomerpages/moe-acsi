Dance Venia was first formed as a new CCA in 2005. ‘Venia’ is a Latin word which can translate to ‘In God’s Grace’.

Unlike other dance groups, we do not specialize in any one form of dance genre.

To date, we have tried Hip Hop, Jazz, Contemporary, Modern, Cha-Cha, Jive, Samba, Salsa, Ballet and even Water Ballet.
