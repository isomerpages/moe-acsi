Orientation Performance 2021&nbsp;

<p>Dance Venia was formed at ACS (Independent) in 2005. In its name, ‘Venia’ is a Latin word meaning ‘In God’s Grace’. Unlike other dance groups, they do not specialize in any one form of dance, choosing instead to cross-train and expose members and the wider school community to various forms. Training with top choreographers in Singapore, to date, they have endeavoured forms such as Hip Hop, Jazz, Contemporary, Modern, Cha-Cha, Jive, Samba, Salsa, Ballet and even Water Ballet. From 2021, membership is open for students from Year 1</p>
