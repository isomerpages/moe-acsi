**Vocal ACcord** is an a cappella society comprised of IB Year 5 and 6 students dedicated to creating music using their natural instrument: their voices. The group also embraces the learning of multiple instruments from beatboxing to using loopers and digital audio workstations, to enhance their performances. Whether it is choral, contemporary pop, R&B tracks, or even Broadway showstoppers, Vocal ACcord is ready to bring the house down!

Our events include performing for the school’s Founder’s Day, Chinese New Year and National Day celebrations. We also take part in the school’s biannual Festival Of Arts and Performing Arts Night Festival, which alternate every year. On top of all of these events, Vocal ACcord will also be holding our very own concert this year in May 2025!

Come and join us every Tuesday and Thursday at the General Music Room (Old Block Red Level, from 1615-1845) or on Zoom (during HBL) for a time of fun and musical joy!
