<p><strong>Here’s what our VA alumni have to say about Vocal ACcord!</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I chose to join VA as music is a really big part of my life. Having had been in choir since primary school, I wanted to continue having an avenue to explore music together with a community of people!</em>
</p>
<p><em>In VA, we work together as a community to work towards shared goals that we have – to improve our musicianship, and to put on a good performance. Despite our busy schedules, we all still put in our best effort into each and every practice. This is something I’ll always be grateful to all our members for.” –</em><strong><em>Ryan Ng (6.17)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I heard about VA even before joining ACSI and knew that I wanted to join right away, only a bonus that VA always has a great community.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Performing and singing is basically my whole life and it’s a huge part of who I am. I love that we’re a group that’s come together to make music. It’s almost like a second family.” –</em><strong><em>Lyane Chan (6.10)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I listened to Amane Kanata’s cover of “Umi to Shika” back in Secondary 3 and wanted to learn singing, so I joined VA when I had the chance to change CCAs in year 5.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The closely knit group of people with high initiative are just nice to exist around; they can elevate your experience from one of mere existing to living.” –&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Paw Qin Hang (6.14)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“The happiness I get from entertaining others is my favourite part about singing and performing. Singing has been one of my favourite hobbies. I wanted a chance to have some vocal training and get back in a performing arts CCA after 5 years, so I joined VA.</em> 
<br><em>My favourite things about VA? Definitely the community spirit and its student-led nature.” –</em><strong><em>Ryan Yong (6.11)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I chose to join VA as I was in choir in secondary school and thought it would be a nice change of pace. I enjoy and feel immense gratification when the group singing coalesces into a whole.” –</em><strong><em>Yeo Hong (6.13)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“VA is so supportive, and everyone’s a friend. Besides, singing helps me to express myself musically and emotionally, while performing helps me to build my confidence.” –</em><strong><em>Matthew Ng (6.15)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I joined VA as I was drawn to its student-led nature. Being able to choose the songs we want to learn and the styles of music we want to experiment with has not been without its challenges, but it’s been incredibly rewarding so far!</em>
</p>
<p><em>I love how we always helpe each other up in VA – everyone is incredibly supportive and kind! VA CCA sessions are probably my favourite part of my week as I get to unwind and have fun with my friends while learning something new together.” –</em><strong><em>Aletheia Kong (6.07)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I love singing and performing as it allows me to showcase my talents and share my joy! The sense of community in VA, as well as how passionate everyone is about singing, are my favourite things about VA.” –</em><strong><em>Chloe Ng (6.10)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I like music and singing, and I enjoy the friendships and supportive environment in VA.” –</em><strong><em>Naomi Chua (6.10)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I like to sing in my free time and have a habit of doing it unconsciously whenever and wherever possible. Singing has been my hobby since I was young, probably due to the influence of my sister and friends.” –</em><strong><em>Darren William Sasmita (6.17)</em></strong>
