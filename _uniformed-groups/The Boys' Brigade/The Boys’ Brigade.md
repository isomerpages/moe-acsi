**History of the Boys’ Brigade 12th(I) Singapore Company**

Though the first Boys’ Brigade (BB) company in Singapore was founded in 1930, the 12th Company, which is linked to the Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) family, was only founded 24 years later, in 1954. At that time, there was only a senior section with an initial enrolment of 44 boys and 4 officers. In 1988, the Singapore Ministry of Education started its Independent School Programme – consequently, the secondary section of ACS was renamed ACS(Independent), and the campus was shifted to Dover Road. This company would eventually become what we know today as the 12th(Independent) Company.

To date, the 12th(I) Company has been consistently performing well. With respect to awards, the Company has attained the JM Fraser Gold Award for Excellence as well as Best Overall Company in Singapore for several consecutive years, as well as produced a large number of Founders’ Men and Presidents’ Award recipients.
