Since its inception in 2001, the ACS(I) NCC (Sea) unit has excelled. Immediately after transferring from NCC (Sea) HQ, the unit competed in the Best Unit Competition (BUC). We garnered a commendable silver, the first in a long line of accolades that would define the unit’s legacy. Since then, the unit has reached even greater heights. With a supportive Senior Administration, our unit has managed to grow in strength and character. Guided by dedicated Teacher Officers and driven by committed cadets, the unit has maintained an unbroken tradition of Gold awards for BUC since 2004. Even after HQ NCC replaced the BUC with an equivalent Unit Recognition (UR) in 2018, we continue to maintain Distinction year after year.

In ACS(I) NCC (Sea), we create an environment that not only allows the cadets to grow in character, but also develops their physical fitness and resilience. Truly, we develop our cadets to have a Fit Body, Resilient Mind, and Committed Heart, all part of the NCC “Cadet Strong” framework. To achieve such excellence, cadets embody the eight NCC Core Values: Loyalty to Country, Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment and Responsibility, Care for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit, Safety. These qualities prepare them beyond the parade grounds, allowing cadets to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.

The NCC (Sea) syllabus aligns with the tri-service curriculum in areas such as footdrills and Individual Field Craft, while also emphasising sea proficiency. Our cadets also learn skills such as kayaking, through the One-Star Kayaking Course (by SCF), and Bends & Hitches, conducted during training. They put these skills to the test in inter-unit events, organised by HQ NCC, such as the Singapore Canoe Marathon (SCM), Mini Kayaking Expedition (MKE), Dragonboat Competition, Sea Challenge and Kayak Sprint Competition.

NCC (Sea) also offers countless unique experiences including overseas opportunities, like the NCC Midshipman Sea Training Deployment (MSTD) where cadets spend 2 weeks living aboard a Landing Ship Tank (LST) to learn about life at sea and the International Cadet Exchange Program (ICEP) that allows cadets to visit foreign nations and interact with cadets from another country. These overseas opportunities allow cadets to build friendships beyond our borders and widen their cultural appreciation. Additionally, they teach important values such as teamwork, leadership and discipline.

To God Be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!
