Founded in 1921, the ACS (Independent) Scout Group consisting of the Scout Unit and Venture Scout Unit is the oldest and largest scout group in Singapore.

### About our Founder

The ACS(I) Scout Troop was founded in 1921 by William Thorpe (W.T.) Cherry Jr, an old boy of the school. He was assisted by Reverend Charles Blackshear (C.B.) Paul, a teacher at ACS. The troop was named the 11th Singapore Troop and was the first school based scout troop in Singapore.

W.T. Cherry Jr was an American who came to Singapore with his father, and spent much of his life on these shores. He was an officer of the Singapore Volunteer Corps and volunteered for military service when war broke out in 1914, during which time he was promoted to Captain.

A Patrol Leader, he was subsequently promoted to the position of Assistant District Commissioner of Singapore District and later became Singapore’s third District Commissioner. Involved in smuggling of food and services to Changi Prison during the Second World War, he was caught and tortured by the Japanese Kempeitai in the YMCA building. As a result of the torture, he was permanently disabled and later evacuated from Singapore to Britain after the war.

### About the Scout Troop

The activities conducted in the scouts are centered on the principles underlined in the Scout Method.

Recruits are taught the tenets of the Scout Law as the very first test that they undergo for their Scout Standard. Scouts are continually reminded of their promise and of the scout law throughout the course of the year.

As part of their Scout Promise, the scouts are obligated to serve the community. This is in line with the school’s long term goal of character building for integrity and development and short term goal of 100% involvement in CIPs, as well as inculcation of Christlikeness and Fruit of the Spirit. This is tied to long term goals dealing with the three desired outcomes of education: knowledge of and belief in one’s own country, care and concern for others and sense of moral integrity.

Scouts are encouraged to experience the great outdoors as often as possible. Preference is given for activities to be conducted outdoors.

The team system, also known as the Patrol System, is put in place to channel the considerable influence that peers and seniors have on each other and juniors in a constructive and personal direction.

As a Patrol of eight to ten, responsibilities, roles and decisions are shared among the members of the Patrol. This provides opportunities for the scouts to unlock their leadership and creativity and develops a mutually supportive team spirit within the patrol.

The progress scheme is the main tool that enables this personal progression. The scheme allows for the conscious development of the skills of the individual scout. It allows the scout to learn at his own pace and according to his areas of interest. It consists of the following:

*   Scouts:
    *   Scout Standard
    *   Advanced Scout Standard
    *   First Class Scout Standard
    *   Chief Commissioner’s Award
*   Venture Scouts:
    *   Venture Scout Standard
    *   Venture Cord
    *   President’s Scout Award

The proficiency badge scheme also caters to the growth of the scouts’ expertise in their personal areas of interest. There are more than 50 badges that may be achieved by the scouts.

The scouts are encouraged to learn by doing. This involves growth based on first hand experience rather than theoretical instruction. It is a reflection of the practical approach based on learning through opportunities for experiences in the interest areas of each scout. The experiential learning is supported by a process of peer and self-evaluation that takes place in the form of discussion, debrief and Patrol-in-Council sessions at the end of an activity or the day.

A set of symbols has been chosen to appeal to the scouts’ imagination and ride on the scouts’ capacity for imagination, creativity and inventiveness. It is intended that the significance of the symbols encountered in their scouting life will stimulate their memories, enabling a deeper impression of the principles of scouting.

The adult leaders are the main driving engine in the scouts. They play a key role in ensuring that every activity is carried out fully and safely.
