<p>The National Cadet Corps (Land) unit in ACS (Independent) has continued
to uphold the values of the Corps in the year 2024.</p>
<p>The Precision Drill Squad (PDS) team trained hard before taking part in
the annual PDS competition. Overcoming the many obstacles and conflicting
schedules, the PDS team showed amazing determination and trained relentlessly
to do their best during the competition.</p>
<p>The unit had also participated in the Founder’s Day Parade by mounting
a Guard-of-Honour contingent. The unit had also been awarded the Distinction
in the HQ NCC Unit Recognition 2023.</p>
<p>Our Unit Sergeant Major (USM) Leo Sun, from the class of 4.11 Stephen,
participated in the International Cadet Exchange Programme (ICEP) Brunei
after undergoing a rigorous selection process in HQ NCC. Leo had acquired
many learning points and jungle survival skills during the ICEP Brunei.
The ICEP Brunei experience had enabled Leo to be a better cadet and contribute
in many ways in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both Leo and Nepolitan Kavin, also from the class of 4.11 Stephen, had
been awarded the Outstanding Cadet Award by HQ NCC, the pinnacle award
for an NCC Cadet.</p>
<p>We would like to commend the appointment holders from the S-team for their
assistance and support. We would also like to thank our Teachers-Officers
(TOs) for their continued guidance, and advice, as well as our cadet officers
for their help and training, without whom none of this would have been
possible.</p>
<p>As we look ahead to another year, we pray for God’s continued blessing
and guidance, growing from strength to strength. To serve with pride and
dedication! To God be the glory, the best is yet to be!</p>
