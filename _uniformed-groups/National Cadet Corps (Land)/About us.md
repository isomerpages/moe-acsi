The National Cadet Corps (Land) unit had a fruitful year where our cadets have done the unit proud. We have broken boundaries, surpassed standards, and have stayed true to our purpose of building character in our cadets.

After achieving the Gold Award in the HQ NCC Best Unit Competition (BUC) for 10 consecutive years, the unit was honoured with the C.M. Phillips Award by HQ NCC, which is a testament of the continued excellence in the unit.

In addition, our cadets continue to receive individual awards (Most Outstanding Cadet Award) and improve in their performances in competitions (Freestyle Drill, Mini-League Challenge, Orienteering, Annual Shooting Competitions).

To broaden the cadets’ horizons, HQ NCC offers opportunities for selected cadets to go for training with SAF.  C/2LT Raymond Sukanto and C/LTA Brandon Lim (Class 6.14 Joppa), had participated in the Basic Airborne Course in June 2013, to attain their silver wings as parachutists as well as a once in a lifetime experience. C/2LT Raymond Sukanto also participated in the Basic Diving Course in Nov 2014.

The year 2011 has been a fruitful one for the National Cadet Corps (Land). For the 9th consecutive year, our unit has achieved the Gold Award in the Best Unit Competition, emerging as one of the top units in Singapore, encompassing all 3 districts of Land, Sea, and Air. Our unit also took part in the 3rd Freestyle Drill Competition, placed among the top 15 units in the West District.

This year has also been an eventful one for us. We had done very well in the 4th Freestyle Drill Competition, and we hope to better ourselves in the years to come. With the new initiative for the NCC to become a Uniformed Group that is Nurturing, Committed and Cool, we can look forward to more exciting and challenging activities, as well as reduced elemental restrictions, meaning that cadets from NCC (Land) can participate in activities previously only limited to NCC (Sea) or NCC (Air)

2011 has certainly been a successful year for us, and we strive to reach greater heights and ‘spur one another toward love and good deeds’. The Best Is Yet To Be!

MSG Lim Xuan Nai Brandon (Class 4.09 Elijah)

Unit Sergeant Major (2012)

The year 2009 had been a bountiful year of achievements for our school’s NCC (Land) unit. For the sixth year running, we clinched the coveted Gold Award in the Best Unit Competition in 2009, finishing as one of the top schools in Singapore. Our cadets also clinched the route championship in the Orienteering Competition and our Part C Team emerged 2nd runner-up in the West District Shooting Competition.

This year has seen an increase in activities undertaken by the unit. The enthusiastic and active participation of the cadets brought our unit to a whole new level. Through all the activities, camps and competitions undertaken, one of our greatest takeaways is the development of a strong and hardy character, championed by many of our unit’s cadets. Competitions we participated in allowed us to build a strong sense of camaraderie and bonding within the unit amongst all levels and ranks. Ultimately, the highlight of the year for many cadets would be the live firing experience, usually only experienced by soldiers and NS men.

2010 has indeed been a successful year for NCC (Land) and we strive to reach greater heights and ‘soar on wings like eagles’, for The Best Is Yet To Be!
