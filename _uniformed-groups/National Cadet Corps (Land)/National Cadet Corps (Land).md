**Loyalty To Country**

Loyalty to and love for country must be deeply ingrained in the hearts and minds of all cadets; these are imbued in the cadets by way of their commitment to serve the nation through maintenance of high discipline and training standards.

**Uprightness**

Exemplary conduct together with strong moral strength to differentiate right from wrong; honesty and truthfulness in carrying out duties with full responsibility.

Role modeling and influencing fellow-cadets to aspire to their highest potential both academically and in NCC training and activities; leadership by example and through involvement with peers and subordinates.

**Discipline**

Timely execution of tasks that have to be done, even though they might be difficult and painful, and doing them to the best of one’s ability; self-discipline that produces mental and physical resilience and strength.

**Commitment & Responsibility**

Taking training seriously and aspiring to benefit optimally from the experiences; show of dedication and pride to the Corps.

Genuine concern for the well being of fellow cadets during and outside training; this care and concern will facilitate esprit de corps and maintain a high level of morale and cohesiveness in the NCC.

**Adventurous Spirit**

The spirit, daring and passion to venture into the unknown, to explore the undiscovered and unchallenged realms; this adventurous spirit will widen the perspective and outlook of our cadets.
