National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) was first formed in Singapore in 1959.  
Since its humble beginnings in Bartley Secondary School with just 30 cadets, NPCC has emerged as one of the largest Uniformed Youth Organizations (UYO) with more than 20, 000 cadets.

The **Mission** of NPCC is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders; by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

The **Vision** of NPCC is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore; one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.

By focusing on our mission and objectives, we believe that:

*   We can grow from strength to strength, both as a cadet and as a person.
*   We can develop leadership qualities, civic and moral values that would be essential to success in life.
*   We will understand better the role of the Singapore Police Force, thus being able to spread word of Crime Prevention.
*   We will learn to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact.
*   Through our constant interaction with the Singapore Police Force, we learn to adopt their high standards of performance, duty and service to the Nation.

**NPCC PLEDGE**

“We the members of the National Police Cadet Corps,  
do here and now solemnly and sincerely pledge that:  
We will always bear true faith and allegiance  
to the President and our Republic of Singapore.  
We will always be loyal and true  
to our country, our people and the government.  
We will always be prepared  
to serve our country and community.  
We will always preserve the peace  
and uphold the law.”
