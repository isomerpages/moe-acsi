The ACS (Independent) NCC Air unit is an award-winning NCC unit, consistently attaining the Certificate of Distinction for the Unit Recognition awards by HQ NCC. The award is also a testament to the dedication and commitment of all ACS (Independent) NCC cadets since 1917 when ACS established one of the first NCC unit in Singapore.

Apart from possessing important attributes such as leadership and discipline, our cadets are also imbued with a sense of loyalty to the country, uprightness, commitment and responsibility, an adventurous spirit and care for fellow cadets, qualities imbibed through challenging military-related activities and invaluable local and overseas opportunities.

The Air unit is also heartened that our cadets have grown from strength to strength with esprit-de-corps through many school-based activities such as aeromodelling, camps, drills, drone flying and other workshops that promote camaraderie in our team.

The ACS(Independent) NCC Air Unit will continue to strive for excellence in all that we do. Our Christian beliefs and principles, together with our ACS Spirit, will continue to guide us.
