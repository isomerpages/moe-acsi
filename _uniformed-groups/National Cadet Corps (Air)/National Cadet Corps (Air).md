The ACS (Independent) NCC Air Unit has, once again, done the school proud by clinching the coveted ‘Gold’ Award and the Overall Best Unit Award through the united efforts of past and present students and teachers. The award is also a testament to the dedication and commitment of all ACS (Independent) NCC cadets since 1917 when ACS established one of the first NCC unit in Singapore.

Apart from possessing important attributes such as leadership and discipline, our cadets are also imbued with a sense of loyalty to the country, uprightness, commitment and responsibility, an adventurous spirit and care for fellow cadets, qualities imbibed through challenging military-related activities and invaluable local and overseas opportunities.

The Air unit is also heartened that our cadets have grown from strength to strength with esprit-de-corps through many school-based activities such as aeromodelling, camps, drills, hikes and workshops that promote camaraderie in our team.

We salute our graduating Yr 4 and Yr 6 students for serving the corp and the school with humility and pride and sincerely wish them the best in all future endeavours.

The ACS(Independent) NCC Air Unit will continue to strive for excellence in all that we do. Our Christian beliefs and principles, together with our ACS Spirit, will continue to guide us.
