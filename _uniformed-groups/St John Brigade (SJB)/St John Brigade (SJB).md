St John Brigade (named officially changed from St John Ambulance Brigade since 2015) has been in existence in ACS (Independent) for more than six decades. The enrolment number has remained at a steady state of about 130 – 150 cadets. The corps offer programmes that catered to the physical, social and mental development of students aged between 13 years to 18 years of age; with activities such as camps, parades, fund raising events, outdoor expeditions, lifesaving skills in CPR/AED and Basic Cardiac Life Support, and many more. Through these activities, students are equipped with 21st Century skills such as social awareness, self-management and responsible decision making.  We have in the past invited eminent and successful alumni to grace the St John Day, including Dr Tan Chi Chiu, Dr Ong Eng Keow, Dr Tan Tze Lee, Dr Ng Liang Wei and Dr Wilfred Peh.
