**Importance of password change**

Students are required to keep their passwords safe and secured at all times and are encouraged to change their passwords regularly.

A Strong Password **should**–

*   Be at least 12 characters in length
*   Contain both upper and lowercase alphabetic characters (e.g. A-Z, a-z)
*   Have at least one numerical character (e.g. 0-9)
*   Have at least one special character (e.g. @, #, $, %, ^)

A Strong Password **should not** –

*   Spell a word or series of words that can be found in a standard dictionary
*   Be based on any personal information such as user id, family name, pet, birthday, etc.

**The following are several recommendations for maintaining a Strong Password:**

*   Change default account passwords
*   Do not share your password with anyone for any reason
*   Change your password upon indication of compromise
*   Consider using a passphrase instead of a password
*   Do not write your password down or store it in an insecure manner
*   Avoid reusing a password
*   Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts
*   Do not use automatic logon functionality
