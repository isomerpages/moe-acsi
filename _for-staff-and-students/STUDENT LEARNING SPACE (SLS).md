From 1 Dec 2022, the [Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login) will adopt the MOE Identity Management System (MIMS) as an authentication system.

For students, the MIMS username is the same as the student’s iCON email address, ending with @students.edu.sg.

MIMS currently serves as the digital identity for students for various MOE applications, e.g. Student iCON. With the onboarding of SLS to MIMS, SLS users (**Students**) will be able to enjoy the convenience of logging into SLS with the same MIMS (iCON) username and password.

So, from 1 Dec 2022, students can login to SLS in two ways

1.  LOGIN WITH SLS (**the SLS username and password remain unchanged**.)
2.  LOGIN WITH MIMS **(iCON login credentials-the same username and password used for your school PLDs)**

For students not yet onboarded to Student iCON and need to know their iCON username may approach to their PCTs.

Students who encounter issues logging into SLS through MIMS and having difficulties signing into your MIMS/Student iCON account should contact the school MIMS Student Administrator (SA) for assistance. Use the following URL [https://forms.office.com/r/cH6sJuC3jA](https://forms.office.com/r/cH6sJuC3jA) for password resetting requests. IT Helpdesk will send a password via your MS Teams.

Refer to the [ePoster](/files/ePoster-for-Students-on-simplified-login-to-SLS-via-MIMS-Updated.pdf) for students on simplified login to SLS via MIMS.
