<p style="text-align: justify;">The safety and well-being of every child is of utmost importance to us. Since January 2023, all students are covered under the GPA Insurance provided by Income Insurance Limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may refer to the product&nbsp;factsheet&nbsp;for more information on the limit for medical expenses, policy coverage, benefits and claim procedures. As medical treatments at private hospitals will typically cost higher, parents may need to pay more out-of-pocket expenses if treatment costs exceed the policy’s coverage limits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Non-Inclusion Under GPA Insurance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that the GPA Insurance&nbsp;<strong>does not cover</strong>&nbsp;the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Treatment incurred more than 365 days from date of accident</li>
<li>Treatment for an injury not as a result of an accident</li>
<li>Private physiotherapy or alternative treatment (such as chiropractic, herbalism, podiatry, naturopathy, Ayurveda, etc.)</li>
<li>Non-prescribed medication or mobility aids (such as crutches, wheelchair, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Enhanced Medical Benefits / Sports CCAs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For parents who require enhanced medical expenses / benefits beyond what is provided by the GPA insurance for their child, they are advised to purchase additional insurance on their own. This may be applicable for those who are involved in sports or other physical CCAs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Filing of Claims</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All claims should be submitted as soon as possible, subjected to a cap of 365 days from the date of the accident. <strong>The first treatment must be sought within 30 days from date of</strong> <strong>accident</strong>. Please refer to the User Guide, which can also found at the same link (<a href="https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/">https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/</a>), for more information on how to submit and view claims. Please note that claims will require prior payment, and reimbursement will be done upon verification and approval of the claims. Ineligible expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the parents.</p>
