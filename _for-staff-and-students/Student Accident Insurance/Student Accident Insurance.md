<p>The safety and well-being of every child is of utmost importance to us. From January 2023, all students will be covered under the GPA Insurance provided by Income Insurance Limited. The cost of this insurance plan is <strong>$3.83</strong> per student and will be deducted via GIRO on 5 May 2023.</p>
<p>The limit for medical expenses (sum of outpatient and inpatient medical expenses) is <strong>$13,000</strong>, incurred up to 365 days from date of accident, and with the sub-limits as stipulated in the Product Fact Sheet found at this link (<a href="https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/">https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/</a>). The Product Fact Sheet will also provide more details on the policy coverage, benefits and claim procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Inclusion Under GPA Insurance</strong></p>
<p>Please note that the GPA Insurance <strong>does not cover</strong> the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Treatment incurred more than 365 days from date of accident</li>
<li>Treatment for an injury not as a result of an accident</li>
<li>Private physiotherapy or alternative treatment (such as herbalism, podiatry, naturopathy, Ayurveda, etc.)</li>
<li>Non-prescribed medication or mobility aids (such as crutches, wheelchair, etc.) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enhanced Medical Benefits / Sports CCAs</strong></p>
<p>For parents who require enhanced medical expenses / benefits beyond what is provided by the GPA insurance for their child, they are advised to purchase additional insurance on their own. This may be applicable for those who are involved in sports or other physical CCAs.</p>
<p><strong>Filing of Claims</strong></p>
<p>All claims should be submitted as soon as possible, subjected to a cap of 365 days from the date of the accident. Please refer to the User Guide, which can also found at the same link (<a href="https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/">https://studentgpa.incomegroupins.com.sg/</a>), for more information on how to submit and view claims. Please note that claims will require prior payment and reimbursement will be done upon verification and approval of the claims.</p>
