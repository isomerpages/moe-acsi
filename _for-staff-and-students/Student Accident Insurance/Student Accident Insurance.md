<p>The safety and well-being of every child is of utmost importance to us.
Since January 2023, all students are covered under the GPA Insurance provided
by Income Insurance Limited. The cost of this insurance plan is <strong>$10.90</strong> per
student and will be deducted via GIRO on 9 May 2025.</p>
<p>You may refer to the <a href="/files/Product_Fact_Sheet_Year_2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">product factsheet </a>for
more information on the limit for medical expenses, policy coverage, benefits
and claim procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Inclusion Under GPA Insurance</strong>
</p>
<p>Please note that the GPA Insurance <strong>does not cover</strong> the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Treatment incurred more than 365 days from date of accident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatment for an injury not as a result of an accident</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced Medical Benefits / Sports CCAs</strong>
</p>
<p>For parents who require enhanced medical expenses / benefits beyond what
is provided by the GPA insurance for their child, they are advised to purchase
additional insurance on their own. This may be applicable for those who
are involved in sports or other physical CCAs with physical activities.</p>
