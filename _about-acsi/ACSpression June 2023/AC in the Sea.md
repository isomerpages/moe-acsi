AC in the Sea, our school's annual family event, took place on 24 May 2023. It was a day of fun, excitement and bonding for the school family. The school's first ever cardboard boat race kick-started the event. The Parent Support Group (PSG) helped with the food stalls at the IB Foyer serving HEYTEA, takoyaki, twisted potatoes, churros and Ramly Burger. In addition, a photo booth was set up by the Christian Ministry. AC in the Sea ended with a grand finale at the Astroturf, where 6 games of bubble soccer took place.
