Hey Y5s! Whether you’ve arrived from the IP or JAE, we warmly welcome you to the start of your IB journey, and to the AC family. :)

The AC family doesn’t just include the staff and students, it comprises alumni, retired staff, and non-academic staff serving the school. Whether it’s a friendly banter with your teachers, a quick purchase of a drink from the SAC, or the quick conversations you’ll have with your classmates, you’ll feel the warmth emanating from this culture. Truly, we are one AC, one family.

Now, as you take on this new chapter in life, the IB journey, take a moment to calm yourself down and focus on the road ahead. Remember to ask yourself: What are my goals? How can I best achieve them? What can I take away from these precious two years?

Of course, on this uneven road, roadblocks and adversities will appear. It could take the form of school stress (those EETOKIA deadlines can get tough), personal issues, or any unfortunate events. These are inevitable, so remember to take them in your stride. Never let these setbacks get in the way of you achieving your goals. Talk to your friends and teachers, build a network, because this race is run together, not alone. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. It’s also great to set aside time for leisure and build stronger bonds with your friends and classmates over activities or a great meal. :)

Do also seek to be a better version of yourself every day. You could develop yourself by selecting a CCA you’re already proficient in and want to improve further, or simply pick up a new skill. Think closely about your subjects as well, you’ll want to do something you’re passionate about. As we all know, results don’t define us.

Moreover, remember to be inclusive and to have one another’s back in times of trouble.

If someone is eating alone, join them! If a classmate is having trouble understanding a concept, try your best to explain it to them. If a classmate is facing struggles, share their burden and help them through it. As cliché as it may sound, we’re all in this together. No one should feel isolated or devoid of a helping hand.

I know, I know, the hours will be long, the deadlines will be daunting. Take these with a positive mindset and remember that it’s the journey that matters, not the destination. Don’t be fazed by these; have fun along the way! You’ll enjoy the small moments of light-hearted jokes in class or that memorable outing with your classmates. 

In short, although IB is going to be tough, you’re all definitely tougher. Enjoy your time here and keep in mind that it’s a journey of a lifetime ahead, where you’ll run the race together.
