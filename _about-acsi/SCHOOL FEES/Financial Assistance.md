**Financial Assistance**

Our school has various financial assistance programmes in place. Should you require assistance with school fees, please approach our Deputy Principal, Mr Patrick Soo ([patrick@acsindep.edu.sg](mailto:patrick@acsindep.edu.sg)) or School Secretary, Ms Eunice Seah (Tel: 6870 0314).

**MOE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS BURSARY**

Singapore Citizens in independent schools may apply for assistance under the MOE ISB scheme. ISB recipients who meet the [criteria](/about-acs-independent/fee/financial-assistance/#UPLIFT) will qualify for the UPLIFT scholarship which consists of a cash award of $800 per annum to help offset the out-of-pocket expenses for students from lower-income households.

<a href="/files/About%20ACS(I)/MOE-ISB-Application-Form-revised-on-14-October-2022.pdf" target="_blank">Application for MOE ISB</a>

Application forms are available from the Front Office and [Parents’ Portal](https://lms.acsindep.edu.sg/ACSIndep/login.aspx?type=parents). Please ensure that the ISB application is accompanied by all relevant documents required by MOE.

Omission may result in a delay in the processing of the application and in turn, a delay in the awarding of the ISB.  Students should pay the full amount of school fees until their application for the ISB has been processed and have received written advice from the School.

Applications may be made throughout the year as exigencies of each family’s financial situation demand.  However, each MOE ISB award is effective from the month the application is approved and <u>may not</u>  be back-dated. Approved ISBs are valid till December of the year. Fresh applications will have to be submitted for each subsequent academic year.

**Income Limits & Benefits**

The student needs only satisfy either the Gross Household Income (GHI) or the Per Capita Income (PCI) criterion. PCI is computed based on the GHI divided by the number of members in the household.

Once approved, the ISB will provide the benefits shown in the table below:


[\[i\]](https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/about-acs-independent/fee/financial-assistance/#_ednref1) Applicable for students enrolled in the IB Diploma Programme only. Exam fees for GCE ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels have been waived for all Singapore citizens in Government-funded schools from 2015.

\* The public transport subsidy will be based on the number of remaining months in the calendar year in which your application is approved.

~ GGAS fee comprises school fee, standard miscellaneous fee and maximum 2nd tier miscellaneous fee payable by Singapore Citizen students in a GGAS.

Should there be a requirement for any further subsidy for any other school activity/programme, parents should write directly to our Deputy Principal, Mr Patrick Soo ([patrick@acsindep.edu.sg](mailto:patrick@acsindep.edu.sg)) and complete the relevant application forms. Full disclosure is necessary for applications to be processed.
