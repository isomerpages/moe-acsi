2.  Fees paid are not refundable.

3.  Under the GIRO scheme, official receipts for payment of school’s fees and miscellaneous fees will not be issued. Deduction will be reflected in the parent’s / guardian’s bank statement.

When the deduction by GIRO scheme is unsuccessful, the invoice for the outstanding amount will sent to parents / guardians at their residential address and through email. A service charge of $20 will be levied for any GIRO failure due to insufficient funds.
