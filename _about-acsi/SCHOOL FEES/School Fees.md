School fees with effect from 1 January 2023 are tabulated below. Admission to our school is merit-based and no Singaporean admitted to ACS (Independent) will be turned away because he / she cannot afford school fees.

Singapore citizens may seek information on the various financial assistance programmes from our Deputy Principal, Mr Patrick Soo (patrick@acsindep.edu.sg).
