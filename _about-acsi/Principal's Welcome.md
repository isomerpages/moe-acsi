<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Principal’s Welcome</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Anglo-Chinese School (Independent)!&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is my honour to serve this community as Principal, especially in a milestone season where the ACS family marks 140 years of heritage and God’s faithfulness. ACS (Independent) stands firmly on foundations shaped by faith, character, and excellence, while remaining deeply committed to preparing our students for the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing world.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our shared theme verse across the ACS family captures both our purpose and our calling:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">— Matthew 5:16&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This verse expresses the heart of an ACS education. It reminds us that learning is never only about personal achievement, but about how our gifts, knowledge, and character are used to serve others and contribute meaningfully to society. At ACS (Independent), we seek to nurture young ACSians who pursue excellence with humility, lead with integrity, and act with compassion.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rooted in the Methodist tradition, ACS has always emphasised the formation of the whole person — intellectually, morally, socially, and spiritually. This commitment is reflected in our strong academic programmes, including both our International Baccalaureate Diploma and Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) Programmes, as well as in our broad and vibrant co-curricular offerings, leadership development opportunities, service-learning initiatives and outdoor education experiences. Through these programmes, students are challenged not only to do well, but to grow resilient, reflective, and responsible.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our vision of developing students as Catalysts for Change, For God and Humanity gives clear direction to this work. A catalyst brings about change by enabling positive transformation around it. In the same way, we hope our students learn to use their abilities to uplift others, to stand for what is right, and to contribute thoughtfully to their communities — locally and globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We describe ACS as a Beacon of Truth and Light in our School Anthem. A beacon exists not to impress, but to serve a larger good — especially in moments of uncertainty. While we celebrate excellence in academics, sports, the arts, and leadership, we believe that true light is seen most clearly in everyday faithfulness: how ACSians steward responsibility, care for one another, and respond with empathy and love in daily interactions. These seemingly small choices shape character and reveal values.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our motto, “The Best Is Yet To Be,” reflects a spirit of hope and continual growth. It is not a guarantee of automatic success, but a statement of faith — a confidence that God is at work in our human selves and in ACS. With trust, humility, and shared purpose, our God promises great goodness ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Principal, I am committed to leading with integrity, clarity, and care, and to working closely with students, staff, parents, alumni, and partners. Together, may we continue to shape an ACS (Independent) community where young people are called not only to excel, but to shine as Catalysts for Change — for God and for Humanity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To God be the Glory!&nbsp; <br>The Best Is Yet To Be!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Kevin Pang <br>Principal, ACS (Independent)</p>
