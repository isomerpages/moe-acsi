Life in the Boarding School is rich and fulfilling. The Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC) provides student leadership opportunities in sports and adventure activities, cultural functions and special events. Some of these events take place at the end of each term:

*   Welcome Night
*   High Table Dinner
*   International Night
*   Thanksgiving Dinner.
