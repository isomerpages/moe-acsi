**Who can stay in the Boarding School? Is it open to non-ACS (Independent) students?**

The Boarding School is open to ACS (Independent) and ACS (International) students. External groups may also make bookings for residential programmes such as camps.

**What do the costs cover?**

The cost includes boarders’ accommodation, meals and laundry services.

**Why isn’t lunch provided on weekdays?**

Weekday lunches are not provided as students and staff are in school during that time. Lunch can easily be purchased from the Students’ Activity Centre in School.

**How are meals in the Boarding School served?**

All meals are served in the Dining Hall. Breakfast, lunch (weekends and Public/School Holidays) can be taken as individuals at specified times. Dinner is served at 1900h and is taken together as a Boarding School family. Students and staff all eat together, in tables of four. Dinner typically comprises rice, soup, a meat dish, a vegetable dish, a side dish and a fruit. For boarders who do not take beef and pork, there are alternatives when the meat is served. Dietary constraints on medical and religious grounds must be declared on the registration form. A Food Committee with representatives from the staff and student body ensures that the food served is nutritious and feedback for improvements is welcomed. Weekend meals (Friday dinner, Saturday and Sunday breakfast, lunch and dinner) must be ordered through the on-line meal-booking system by Wednesday 2359h to reduce wastage.

**What about meals outside of meal times? Can I keep food in the Hall?**

Boarders are allowed to keep their stocks, carefully labeled with name and date, in the refrigerator in the pantry area. A microwave, oven toaster and kettle is provided to prepare snacks. Water-coolers are provided.

**How is laundry managed?**

On registration, boarders are provided with a Laundry Number, marker pens, laundry bag and locker with padlock. All clothing sent to the laundry room will need to be marked clearly and sent to the laundry on a daily basis. The team of laundry maids will wash, iron and return clothes to the specified locker number for collection.

**What if there is an emergency?**

The Boarding School carries out emergency exercises to prepare students for emergency situations that might happen in the Boarding School. All boarders are briefed of safety precautions and evacuation routes at the beginning of each semester and for all newcomers.

**What happens if my child/ward is taken ill?**

If your child/ward is taken ill, you will be contacted and you may wish to take him/her home or he/she can be taken care of by the boarding staff in his/her room or in the medical centre. A health form will need to be completed on registration to enable proper medical attention when needed. Medical bills will be borne by the boarder.

There is a Matron based in the Medical Centre and there are clinics and hospitals nearby. There are facilities for isolation if needed.

**What do I need to bring when checking–in?**

Bring school uniforms and clothing for out-of-school hours. Bed linen (bedsheets and pillow cases) and blankets are provided and boarders are required to change them weekly. New bed linen and blankets are provided through the laundry locker weekly.

**Can I visit my child?**

Yes, but like in school, contact should be made outside of Prep Time. There are telephones in each hall and your child/ward will inform you of the number he can be reached. The postal address for correspondence is:
