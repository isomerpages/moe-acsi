**ACS Heritage & Alumni Centre**

To mark ACS’ 135th anniversary in 2021, the school opened the ACS Heritage & Alumni Centre on 1 March 2021. This centre aims to inspire ACS staff, students, alumni and the wider community with stories of the past as part of the school’s effort on character, values and well-being education. The centre will serve as a repository for artefacts as well as an e-experience for visitors to conduct archival and research activities.
