# School Profile

Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) was founded by Methodist Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham in 1886 with the purpose of nurturing students to be of service “for God and Humanity”.

In January 1988, ACS became among the first schools to turn independent as part of the Ministry of Education’s initiative to diversify the national education landscape[\[1\]](https://www.acsindep.moe.edu.sg/about-acs-independent/school-profile/#_ftn1) and subsequently the school was renamed ACS (Independent).

A Methodist institution, ACS (Independent) has a strong foundation in spiritual values, a tradition of excellence and a global perspective. It was authorised as an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School in 2005 and is the pioneer national school to offer the IB Diploma Programme. Today the school offers two academic tracks:

– the four-year Express programme leading to the GCE O-Level Examinations, and  
– the six-year Integrated Programme (IP) leading to the IB Diploma programme.

The IP allows students to progress from secondary to pre-university education without the requirement to sit the GCE O-Level Examinations.

The core purpose of our school remains to nurture ACSians to be catalysts for change with Godly values and robust character, equipped and willing to serve and lead in the family, nation and the global community. Our mission is to be a world-class institution, a beacon of truth and light, through the holistic development of our students.

Our school vision for Years 1 – 4 students is:  
Every ACSian a Scholar, Officer, Gentleman  
For God & Humanity

Our school vision for Years 5 and 6 students is:  
Every ACSian a Scholar, Leader, Global Citizen  
For God & Humanity
