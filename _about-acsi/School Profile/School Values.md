# School Values

Our Values are Steadfastness, Humility, Integrity, Empathy, Loyalty and Diligence (SHIELD)

Our ideal is Christlikeness, and we are inspired by the values espoused from the life and teachings of Christ.

The purpose of a shield is to guard and protect.  We believe that living by our school values – represented by the acronym – SHIELD – will serve to guide and guard ACSians in their relationships, judgment and decision-making as they navigate through the complexities of life.
