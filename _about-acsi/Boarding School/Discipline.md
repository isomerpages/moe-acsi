The Boarding School is a secure environment. Every boarder receives a set of the Boarding Schoolâ€™s rules and regulations when they take up residence. In addition, each Hall also has its own specific administrative procedures and characteristic approach to guidance and discipline.

Boarders do have some restrictions on items which they may bring into the Hall. In particular, they should not bring any of the following:

*   desktop computers
*   refrigerators or coolers
*   television sets and large audio equipment
*   skateboards, bicycles or other vehicles
*   cooking appliances

Visitors are permitted, but only in the common areas, and only with the permission of the Hall staff. No visitors of the opposite sex are allowed unless they are approved relatives. Boarders need permission to visit Halls other than their own, and also need permission to leave the premises at any time, or to return late (after 10 pm).
