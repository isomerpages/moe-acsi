Each Hall of Residence has rooms with 6 beds, 4 beds or 2 beds. Allocation of boarders to rooms is done by the Hall Staff, who takes into account the age, responsibility level, and specific needs of each boarder.

Each room has attached bathroom facilities, built-in cupboards and desks. Hot water, air-conditioning and ceiling fans are also provided. The Halls each have one/two lounges, television, internet access, a pantry and study rooms for common use.
