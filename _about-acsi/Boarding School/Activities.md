Life in the Boarding School is rich and fulfilling. The Junior Common Room Committee (JCRC) provides student leadership opportunities in sports and adventure activities, cultural functions and special events. Some of these events take place at the end of each term:

*   Welcome Night
*   High Table Dinner
*   International Night
*   Thanksgiving Dinner.

The JCRC committee also organises interhall activities ranging from sports-related to bonding activities to enrich the interactions between boarders, such as ACSpecial 2022

Academic support is provided through ‘Prep Time’, which involve nightly two-hour homework and study preparation sessions. They are supervised by hall staff, who are ACS (Independent) teachers.

There are also weekly fellowship meetings known as ‘Koinonia’, in which inspiring testimonies, songs, music and messages are shared between staff, boarders and invited guests.
