and miscellaneous fees will not be issued. Deduction will be reflected

<p>4.Parents/guardians are advised to ensure that sufficient funds are available
in their accounts on the due dates. When the deduction by GIRO scheme is

/ guardians at their residential address and through email. An administrative
charge of $20 will be levied for any GIRO failure due to insufficient funds.</p>

MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB) Scheme and/or School-based Financial
Assistance Schemes. Please refer to the school’s website for details.</p>
