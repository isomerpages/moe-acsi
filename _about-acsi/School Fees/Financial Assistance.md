<p><strong>Financial Assistance</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school has various financial assistance programmes in place. Should
you require assistance with school fees, please approach our Deputy Principal,
Mr Patrick Soo (<a href="mailto:patrick@acsindep.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">patrick@acsindep.edu.sg</a>)
or School Secretary, Ms Eunice Seah (<a href="mailto:eunice@acsindep.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">eunice@acsindep.edu.sg</a>).</p>
<p><strong>MOE INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS BURSARY</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore Citizens in independent schools may apply for assistance under
the MOE ISB scheme. For ISB recipients who qualify for 100% fee subsidy
and subsidy such that they pay the same fees as students studying in government
and government aided schools, they will qualify for the UPLIFT scholarship,
which consists of a cash award of $1,000 per annum, to help offset the
out-of-pocket expenses for students from lower-income households.</p>
<p><a href="/files/MOE_ISB_Application_Form_2025.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Application for MOE ISB</a>
</p>
<p>Application forms are also available from the Front Office and the&nbsp;
<a href="https://lms.acsindep.edu.sg/ACSIndep/login.aspx?type=parents" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parents’ Portal</a>. Please ensure that the ISB application is accompanied
by all relevant documents required by MOE.</p>
<p>Omission may result in a delay in the processing of the application, and
in turn, a delay in the awarding of the ISB.</p>
<p>Students should pay the full amount of school and miscellaneous fees until
their application for the ISB has been processed and they have received
written advice from the school.</p>
<p>Applications may be made throughout the year as exigencies of each family’s
financial situation demand. However, each MOE ISB award is effective from
the month the application is approved and may not be backdated. Approved
ISBs are valid till December of the year. Fresh applications will have
to be submitted for each subsequent academic year as the ISB is tenable
for that year only.</p>
<p><strong>Income Limits &amp; Benefits</strong>
</p>
<p>The student needs to only satisfy either the Gross Household Income (GHI)
or the Per Capita Income (PCI) criterion. PCI is computed based on the
GHI divided by the number of members in the household.</p>
<p>Once approved, the ISB will provide the benefits shown in the table below:</p>
