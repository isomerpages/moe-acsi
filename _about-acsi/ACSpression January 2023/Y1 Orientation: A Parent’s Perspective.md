On 10 January 2023, the excitement in the air was palpable as 260 new Year One parents supported their sons in school for an orientation. Organised by the ACS (I) Parent Support Group (PSG), the event saw parents in their sons’ classrooms, attending briefings by the PSG volunteers who enthusiastically shared their experiences and insights into their sons’ ACS (I) journey. The event was made more special and memorable this year as it was the first in-person orientation, since the lifting of the Covid restrictions.

The PSG warmly welcomes new Year One parents and we look forward to partnering you in our sons’ journey at ACS (I).
