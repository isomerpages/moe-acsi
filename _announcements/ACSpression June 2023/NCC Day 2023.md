The observance ceremony to commemorate the National Cadet Corps Day 2023 on 6 July was held indoors due to inclement weather but this did not dampen our high spirits. It was indeed a great opportunity for the 3 NCC units, NCC (Land), NCC (Sea) and NCC (Air), to come together as one NCC, amidst the various training commitments.

The cadets put up a strong showing despite many challenges. The standards of the drills were high and polished, and everyone performed well, making it a meaningful and enriching event for all of us.

To serve with pride and dedication.
