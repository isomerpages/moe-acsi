Aesthetics e-Symposium: Reimagining Possibilities and Synergies Through The Arts

The inaugural Aesthetics e-Symposium: Reimagining Possibilities and Synergies Through The Arts on 17 November 2022 delved into new directions and perspectives in arts education, investigating the growing need to develop future-ready individuals in an ever-changing landscape. Together with our guest speaker Mrs Valarie Wilson, the Art and Music teachers from our Aesthetics Department presented their pedagogical innovations in lessons and collaborative projects such as our ACS(I) _Wall Of Sound_ series to show how our school has attempted to rethink our approaches to artistic creativity. Attended by teachers from the Art and Music fraternities across the country, the e-Symposium explored the role of the arts in  society, and how arts education has evolved to address the 21st century competencies.
