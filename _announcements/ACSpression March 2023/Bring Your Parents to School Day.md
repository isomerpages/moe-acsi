On 3 March, parents of our Year 1 students were invited to attend school with their children at the Bring Your Parents to School Day

Parents got an authentic school experience by queuing up with their sons for the morning assembly, and a three-hour rotational programme which gave them a chance to have breakfast with their sons at the SAC. They enjoyed a personalised school tour, student-led presentations in class and interacting with their sonsâ€™ PCTs.
