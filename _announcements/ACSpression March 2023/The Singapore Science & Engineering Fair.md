**The Singapore Science & Engineering Fair**

The Singapore Science & Engineering Fair (SSEF) is a national competition organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR), and Science Centre Singapore (SCS). The SSEF is affiliated to the prestigious International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) and is regarded as the Olympics of science competitions.

This year we had a total of 9 out of 11 projects shortlisted for the final poster presentations from 8-9 March 2023. After much hard work, two of our projects managed to impress the judges and clinched the Gold and Merit awards. The Gold award was awarded to the team comprising Joseph Edwin Selvakumar, Joy Merwin (4.10), Dhruv Prakash (4.09) and Casey Chan (4.09) for their research on Varying Voltages of Electro-Culture on the Growth of Amaranthus Dubius and Its Applications in Singapore’s Market” while the team comprising Elliott Elijah Yeo Shao Ern (4.10), Jonathan Chan Jian Yao (4.10) and Tan Yong Le Timothy (4.10) worked on a research project entitled Determination and Extension of Shelf life of Eruca Vesicaria using Mango Seeds was awarded a Merit award. Both teams were also awarded the Singapore Association for the Advancement of Science (SAAS) Special Award for their excellent science communications.
