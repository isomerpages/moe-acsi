**Founder’s Day Wall of Sound (WoS) 2023**

As part of our 137th Founder’s Day celebrations, the Choir, Vocal Accord, Philharmonic Orchestra and Symphonic Band came together to perform this year’s Wall of Sound (WoS). Joined by various staff members, they led the service with gusto and fervour, uniting the school in a time of worship.
