On 14 March, guests from the National Library Board (NLB) conducted a Dungeons & Dragons Character Creation Workshop with student librarians from ACS(I) and other interested students.  We hope that the students will volunteer to conduct similar workshops for the public in the future.

*“The workshop was interesting and left room for creativity for the game masters and players. The storyline planned out was not followed rigidly and participants could determine the outcome of their adventure.”*
 – Tan Ee Cheong, 3.14.
