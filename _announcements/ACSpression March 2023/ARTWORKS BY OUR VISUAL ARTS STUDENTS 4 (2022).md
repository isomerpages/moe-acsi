On 8 November, the 2022 IB HL Visual Arts students hosted a gallery night. They displayed a selection of artworks which comprised mediums ranging from oil and acrylic paints, colour pencil, charcoal, and paper sculpture.

This series was created by Lauryn Tachibana.

Title of the art piece    _Thinker (2022)_

Media                          Charcoal, pastels, acrylic and newspaper on canvas

Dimensions                 80.5 x 100 cm

The state of being is adrift in the recesses of your own mind that you completely lose touch with reality. You are a boat unanchored and adrift in the psyche, barely able to see the shores of the physical world through a spyglass. It is a space of overcrowded words and vacuums of space. No touch, only sight and thought. My use of charcoal was inspired by Odilon Redon, and his subjects of monsters and dreams.

Title of the art piece    _Sacred Ground (2022)_

Media                          Acrylic on canvas

Dimensions                 80.5 x 100 cm

Nature is the embodiment of the physical and textural. It is the being that breathes, touches and is. It represents the supremacy of the senses that cleanses the world of the cognitive. I wanted this piece to represent a body returning to the living world, guided towards spiritual enlightenment.
