_Welcoming overseas scholars to the ACS(I) Family_

 On 28 February 2023, ACS(I) and the Parent Support Group welcomed 36 scholars and 16 host families with an evening of sumptuous food catered by Hiding Place Kitchen, old-school ice cream from Chip Guan Heng, a specially designed game and photobooth.

The Boarding Hall was abuzz as it was the first introduction of host parents to the boarders from Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. Madam Yong and Madam Hwee Hwee began by thanking all the host parents and sharing invaluable advice on how to make this adoptive journey a meaningful one.

The senior boarders, Andrew Nicholas Wyrtzen and Isaac Wan also shared their personal experiences on how they enjoyed the home-cooked meals, planned excursions and received encouragement notes from their host families.

The rest of the evening was a time of fellowship which allowed host families and scholars to mingle. Everyone left with their hearts a little fuller that evening.
