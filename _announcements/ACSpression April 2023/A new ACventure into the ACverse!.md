February kicked off with a bang as we welcomed the newly inducted Year 5s into the school family! For the first time in 3 years, the annual Year 5 Orientation set off at full steam, with the complete easing of Covid-19 regulations. 

The theme for Orientation 2023 was “Into the ACverse”, which aptly signified the beginning of the Year 5s’ chapter in AC. Each OG was assigned to a unique cartoon mascot in line with the theme, and the programme saw the 18 OGs donning their colourful flags and identities proudly.

In the course of 2 weeks, the Year 5s, led by their respective OGLs, took part in an array of enriching activities, ranging from the level-wide heritage trail, CCA fair, games. Behind the scenes, the OGLs from the different sub-committees worked tirelessly over a few months in the elaborate preparation of different segments in the Orientation.

We would like to thank the OGLs and teachers for contributing to the success of Orientation 2023. We hope the Year 5s have enjoyed themselves in these 2 weeks and forged lasting      camaraderie with their peers.

Wishing all Year 5s the very best for the road ahead! 

To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be.
