One of the first things I noticed as I stepped into the school compound last year was the constant whispers echoing around the school complex. Don’t get me wrong - my secondary school had its fair share of gossip; this wasn’t the first time I was exposed to stories (often false ones) about people whose names I’d never heard. However, the various branches and extensive roots of ACSI’s rumour mill transported gossip from the old block to the IB block and back at lightning speed, like nothing I’d witnessed before. From confession pages to screenshots of close friends’ list stories circulated, no one seemed to be safe from our school’s rumour mill.

While the startling speed at which news travelled throughout our rather massive campus intimidated me initially, it soon became a somewhat comforting constant. Two weeks into orientation, and the ears and mouths connected to every wall by an invisible thread became a round-the-clock presence. I was well-aware that “the walls” picked up the faintest of wishes, secrets murmured by students under their breaths, but this was no longer a threat.

Now, the corridors where I catch up with friends from different classes to exchange the latest news are probably one of my favourite places in school. During the transit between lessons, the _tittle-tattle_ is a welcome pause.

ACSI’s culture of gossip isn’t all that toxic or inane. It spices up our school life and adds giggles to the mundaneness of IA submissions and timed practices. Countless times, it’s provided me with respite from the stress of IB, the monotony of studying the same 6 subjects non-stop. Speculating who the latest couple or how the most recent breakup occurred are interesting occasionally.

Plus, there’s always an opt out option! It’s much easier than it seems to disconnect yourself from the seemingly endless string of speculations and bavardage. Simply plug in your earphones, play your favourite tunes, kick back your feet, and tune out.

In case you’re interested in keeping up with the rumour mill but not sure how to prevent yourself from getting too caught up, here’s a quick guide on surviving ACSI’s notorious rumour mill —

1.  Don’t believe everything you hear.
2.  Be careful what you wish for (out loud).
3.  Choose your friends (and your fellow _tea[**\[1\]**](#_ftn1)_ – steepers) wisely.

All the best navigating through ACSI’s walls, ceilings, and doors. 😉

Remember the importance of detoxing every now-and-then and not getting too distracted by it!
