On 15 April 2023, ACS(I) welcomed more than 2000 prospective students and parents to our second physical Open House since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the bustling crowd up the school’s iconic driveway, one could not help but be caught up in the excitement and anticipation of the morning.

Student leaders put on their best smiles and proudly led visitors around the campus and its amenities. Prospective students and their parents fanned out through the different locations, listening attentively to the student helpers share more about their experiences in AC - from CCAs to academic programmes. The guests were entertained by the Performing Arts outdoor showcases.

As the Open House drew to a close, a deep sense of satisfaction pervaded all of us having demonstrated the strength of the AC spirit and culture amidst the dazzling kaleidoscope of red, blue and gold in all its AC glory!
