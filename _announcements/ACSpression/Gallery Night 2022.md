On 8 November, the 2022 IB HL Visual Arts students hosted a gallery night. They displayed a selection of artworks which comprised mediums ranging from oil and acrylic paints, colour pencil, charcoal, and paper sculpture.

The cohort prepared platters of cheese and crackers, smoked salmon, and grapes to enhance the experience of the visitors. Soft jazz music playing in the background and the chatter of the guests shaped the ambience. The audience was enthusiastic and asked many questions, all the while appreciating the wide array of artworks, which explored universal themes. Through the curatorial rationales and exhibition texts displayed next to each artwork, the audience learned more about the decision-making process of the students and the meaning that each piece intended to convey. The gallery night was a huge success, with an audience of over 70 peers, teachers, and family members. The students were grateful for this opportunity to see their individual pieces come together to form a cohesive exhibition.
