From 18 October to 4 November 2022, the Shaw Library organised a book sale for staff and students. Lots of hard work and preparation by student librarians and staff went into the planning of this event.

We would like to thank our Chief Librarian, Mr Leo Joon Meng, for spearheading the initiative, our student librarians for volunteering during recess and after curriculum hours and our teacher librarian, Ms Ong Siew Lian.
