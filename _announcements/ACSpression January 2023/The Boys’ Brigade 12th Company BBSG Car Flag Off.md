The BB 12th company held the BB Share-A-Gift car flag off on 2 December 2022. The car flag off is an annual event where the 12th Company works together with volunteer drivers to deliver food hampers containing halal canned food, biscuits and many more items to those in need.  
84 drivers reached out to over 700 households during the festive season.

_“The experience brought about an inspiring feeling of elation and purpose, which was evident through the faces of the many who volunteered their services to the cause. It was truly a refreshing and novel experience after the pandemic.”_

SGT/3 Tan Eu Meng, Samuel 3.16

We would like to thank all the volunteers for making this event a success. We look forward to seeing you next year.
