The Impactmakers Internship is a programme launched by the St Andrew’s Autism Centre (SAAC). The three interns in this programme from ACS(I) were assigned to different departments – Corporate Communications, Allied Professionals and Teaching in the Day Activity Centre (DAC) and Autism School.

Here are the thoughts and reflections of two interns of the 2022 Year 6 cohort who are    undergoing the internship:

Jolene: As an intern of the Allied Professionals department in the Autism School, I assist in occupational, speech, and psychological therapies for students. Though I applied for the internship due to my interest in allied healthcare professions, having never interacted meaningfully with individuals with autism, I now find that working with the students is my favourite part of the job! Whether helping a non-verbal student gradually learn to communicate her request for Oreos using a communication board with the speech therapist, or understanding the cause of a student’s challenging behaviour with the psychologist and occupational therapist, I learn new things every day. The idea of having to work daily with colleagues much older than me used to worry me, however, I am glad to realise that the allied professionals are incredibly welcoming, patiently answering my questions and explaining their strategies of handling students. I’m glad to have the opportunity to grow and serve others through my time at SAAC.

Jan: Initially, I was disappointed to learn that I would not be attached to the allied healthcare department – my area of interest. As time passed, however, I realised there was a lot of fulfilment to be found in the work I was doing at the DAC. Posted to Sengkang’s DAC, my job scope includes helping coaches look after clients. The DAC help clients live an independent and dignified life. I accompany clients to sessions of mentally stimulating activities, such as arts and crafts. It was interesting to see how each client had a unique personality. For example, one of the clients particularly enjoys doing artwork based on his experiences, while another likes challenging himself with wordsearches and colouring worksheets. Though some clients are nonverbal, they are still very communicative, using visuals and gestures to express their needs.

We are grateful for opportunities to learn more about autism.
