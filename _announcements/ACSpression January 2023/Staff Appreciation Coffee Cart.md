On the 2nd&nbsp;day of school, 4th&nbsp;January 2023, Living Watersâ€™ Methodist Church organised a Staff Appreciation Coffee Cart for all staff of the school.

This was to thank all staff for their faithful service, and to encourage them as they start the new academic year.

Many of them did not leave immediately after getting their drinks but stayed to catch up and bond over coffee or hot chocolate with their peers and the chaplaincy team.

The church hopes that this initiative will encourage the staff and cheer them on as they begin 2023.
