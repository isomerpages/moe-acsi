I have been in the Boys’ Brigade since my primary school days. I am honoured to be the Company’s Parade Sergeant Major for this year’s Boys’ Brigade Day. I am also delighted to be a part of this family supporting and encouraging each member.

This year’s parade is also a remarkable one because for the past two years, it has been trying as we faced many challenges due to the pandemic. Participating in a full-scale parade for this year’s Boys’ Brigade Day marked a return to normalcy. We are thankful for the opportunity and look forward to more events in the future.
