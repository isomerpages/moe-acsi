On 11 January 2023, the Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) Band had the privilege of hosting the U.S. 7th Fleet Band. Our brass members participated in masterclasses led by their members, culminating in the performance of a combined piece, the _Thunderer March_. Thereafter, students from the Band and the Music Elective Programme (MEP) were treated to a performance by the quintet from the 7th Fleet Band, which included the folk song _The Blue Bells of Scotland_ and the movie soundtrack _We Don’t Talk About Bruno_ amongst others.

The Band benefited immensely from this experience, not only learning how to enhance our musical skills but also finding out more about their role in serving their country. The session made us aware that there is more to making music than just rote playing and served as a timely reminder that each instrument in a band plays an indispensable role in bringing a piece of music to life. We were greatly inspired by the 7th Fleet Band and will aim to maintain a high standard of musical excellence in our Band!
