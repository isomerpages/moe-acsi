On 29 Oct 2022, 32 Humanities and Social Sciences Research Programme (HSSRP) participants presented their research papers at the annual HSSRP Symposium, organised by the MOE Gifted Education Branch on Zoom. In addition, Isaac Yeo of 3.16 and Richhariya Akshat of 3.13 served as emcee and moderator respectively during the keynote session of the symposium.

The annual symposium marked the grand finale of the HSSRP, a prestigious and rigorous research programme for students under the mentorship of academic researchers from various tertiary institutions in Singapore, as well as teachers from ACS(I). 2022 saw the highest number of ACS(I) students admitted into the programme.

Our students choose topics from Psychology, Political Science, History, Geography, Philosophy and the Social Sciences. They have learnt to hone their skills in research, critical thinking, communication, problem-solving and collaboration with organisations beyond the classroom.
