Like any popular game, orientation is split into levels. Four levels, to be specific. Depending on how extroverted or introverted you are, the difficulty can range from easy to expert. But fear not, I have created this beginner’s guide to help you, player one, clear this game with a high score.

Level 1: Gearing up

Whether you are free-to-play or a whale, it is crucial to obtain the right gear before starting your adventure. No, this does not mean you need to waste money on buying potions that give you a 10% extrovert bonus or items that give you a coolness buff. It just means to spend some time finding out what to expect on your first day of school. You may ask, how can I find this overpowered adventure guide? The answer to this question is asking a senior who studies in ACS(I). If you don’t know anyone from ACS(I), do not fret, the world isn’t coming to an end. Just pop on over to Reddit. The questions plaguing your mind might have already been asked. If it isn’t, type your question in r/sgexams, and other players you don’t even know will come to your save.

Furthermore, if you don’t have an Instagram account yet, it might be a good time to set one up. It will act as your quest menu. The “wise ones” – your OGLs will share information like what materials you might need to obtain to complete the quest “Prep for School”.

Level 2: Finding party members

If you’ve ever played Apex Legends, you would know that playing with friends gives you +5% EXP to time survived. Unfortunately, in real life, you do not get EXP that would help you level up. However, the more members in your party, the more the overall difficulty level decreases. A good team always has a well-rounded combination. A mage might not be able to single-handedly slay a boss; they might need the help of a healer or a berserker to either provide heals or deal short-range attacks while you handle long-range. Finding comrades is essential; you will realise how important it is when you reach level 3.

I’ve explained why party members are important; now, how do you get other players to join your party? The first step is to roll a high initiative. Try your best to initiate conversations with other players. An excellent way to start is to introduce yourself and ask for their username. Next, invest some skill points into upgrading your listening skills. Active listening will help you pick up on their interests and keep the conversations going. Believe in the heart of cards and draw the reply card that will make you seem friendly and interested.

Level 3: The science part

An essential part of your orientation storyline is the “Group 4 project” side quest. It acts as a tutorial to the subsequent acts of your IB experience in ACS(I). You co-op with your party members to complete this quest that is a requirement for reaching the end game: receiving your IB diploma. Now that may have e the evoked the “fear” status on you. But here you go, drink this “It is not graded” status nullification potion. But that does not mean you should not take this seriously. Tutorials are important. They prepare you for the actual trials you need to face later. Choose good party members, brainstorm and find a solution to slay this mighty beast. Remember, make sure your presentation focuses on the science of things. After all, this level is called “The science part”.

The ‘Final’ Boss: Doing it all over again

Aah, at last, we have reached the final boss. Well, the final, not so final boss. Player one, reflect on the skills and members you have obtained along the way. Recall the experience and triumphs. All this will come in handy on the gruelling journey ahead. The experiences will serve as your guidebook for the rest of the levels in this game called “ACS(I): the IB journey”. You have done it once; now, you just have to do this all over again when you have moved to your new classes based on your subject combinations. Get along with your fellow classmates, be it bard, cleric, paladin, warlock or wizard and have a fruitful adventure ahead.

After all, the best is yet to be!
