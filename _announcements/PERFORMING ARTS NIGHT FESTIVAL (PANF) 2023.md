<p><strong>To Greater Heights </strong></p>
<p>This year, our Performing Arts participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). With their hard work and enduring efforts, they clinched 7 Distinctions and 2 Accomplishments.</p>
<p>To be able to perform at the Esplanade is no small feat. Your attendance for this event would hold great significance and meaning, to spur and encourage our students as they continue their pursuits to be the best that they can be.</p>
<p>We look forward to having your support as we come together as a school family for PANF 2023.</p>
<p>To God Be The Glory!</p>
