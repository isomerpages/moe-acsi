On August 9, 2023, seven members of the ACS (I) scout troop participated in the National Day Observance Ceremony at Yuhua Community Club. We began the ceremony with a parade, led by our Scout Leader, Wong Leong Tze Ethan. Thereafter, we ran a booth featuring traditional games, specifically hopscotch. We put a lot of effort into designing the hopscotch boards to make them as engaging and attractive as possible. We enjoyed celebrating National Day with members of the public, which served as a reminder of our strong Singaporean spirit.
