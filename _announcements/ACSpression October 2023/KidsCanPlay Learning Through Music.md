KidsCanPlay! is a project that aims to teach fundamental music skills to children of all backgrounds, including those with special needs. Over the past few years, our team of IB students has worked with several voluntary welfare organizations, including the Rainbow Centre, to deliver experiential music programs.
In June 2023, 26 KidsCanPlay! members successfully delivered a 3-day music programme for 12 children with special needs at the Rainbow Centre. The programme introduced a range of percussion, string, and woodwind instruments, and helped these children discover different musical tones and textures. The children particularly enjoyed the hands-on opportunity to make music with instruments!
It was a joy to see the children with special needs respond with curiosity and enthusiasm to music. Music can help children with special needs develop their social skills, expressiveness, and cognitive abilities. We are grateful for the opportunity to share the gift of music with all children, regardless of their abilities.
