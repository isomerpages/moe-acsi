Eleven staff members represented the school in the annual Inter-JC staff football tournament at Victoria Junior College on October 11, 2023.
Despite the sweltering heat and lingering haze, the determined team doubled their points from 2022, scoring six goals in the process. In their final game against Jurong Pioneer JC, the team found their shooting form, scoring three goals in six minutes. Mr. Phee Beng Chang scored twice in quick succession, followed by a third goal from Mr. Wong Ping Loong. Despite JPJC's attempts to salvage the game until the final second, our team's disciplined defence held firm, and the game ended in a nail-biting 3-2 victory.
Our preparations for the next season start now, and we seek to do even better in 2024. The best is yet to be!
