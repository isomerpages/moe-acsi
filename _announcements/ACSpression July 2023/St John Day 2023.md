On 27 June, the St John cadets commemorated St John Day. The parade contingent comprised Year Two, Three and Four cadets, who were dressed smartly in their full brigade uniforms. The parade commander was Senior Staff Sergeant, Ranen Tan Zhen Yi from class 4.11.

Our alumnus and Guest-of-Honour, Dr. Benjamin Tan, a consultant neurologist and clinical scientist at the National University Hospita graced the occasion and shared his experiences in ACS(I) with the cadets.

_â€œDuring my four years in St John, I have worked closely with many capable people who pushed me on to become not only a better leader but also a better person. The friendships and memories that I have made with my fellow cadets, peers and seniors will always be cherished."_
