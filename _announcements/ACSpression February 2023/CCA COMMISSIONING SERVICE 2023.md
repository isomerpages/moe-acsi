The presentation of the school flag signifies the trust invested in students to carry forward the ethos of sportsmanship while representing the school. The flag grounds us in “Staying Anchored, Connected and Steadfast” amid all challenges, and receiving the flag acknowledges our duty in striving to glorify the AC family through our respective CCAs.

Leading the student body in the CCA commissioning pledge was a surreal experience everyone recited the pledge in a collective voice. As we pledged our commitment to our respective CCAs there was a sense of pride and responsibility.
