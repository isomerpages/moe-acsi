The IB evening was held on 6 February 2023 providing an opportunity for the Year 5 students to equip themselves with knowledge prior to choosing their subjects. Numerous subject booths, each piled high with textbooks and informative pamphlets engaged students on the respective subjects.

As people streamed into the hall, dilemmas weighed on troubled minds as the Year 5s considered which subjects to study. Many student volunteers and alumni readily shared their insights with the Year 5s and their parents. Students navigated the crowds together while parents weighed in with questions, concerned about their childrenâ€™s future. It truly was a time of growth and learning for all, paving the way to an education for life.
