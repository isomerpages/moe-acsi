This series was created by Leah Gwen Woo Zhongling.

Title of the art piece    *Participatory Observer (2022)*

Media                          Acrylic on canvas

Dimensions                 50.5 x 101.5 cm

This piece aims to juxtapose the restrictiveness of dwelling and overthinking, with the liberation from seeking contentment in detaching from the past. This dichotomy is shown via the symbol of the blanket. In the painting, the folds tightly winding the body appear complex, but become simple when outstretched by a person’s decision to hold it at a distance. This idea of healthy detachment is contrasted by the depiction of spiraling within complexity in _Incomprehensible Synthesis._

Title of the art piece: *Mirror: Truth Untold (2022)*

Media: Colour pencil, acrylic & oil on canvas

Dimensions: 76 x 76 cm

This piece aims to question the extent to which a person is shaped by external settings. The skin is rendered with non-naturalistic colours, depicting the environment as internally absorbed and reflected. Linking to disjointed identity in Incomprehensible Synthesis, one’s fragmentation is shown in harsh shadows and repetition of lines segregating form. The triangular composition highlights posture casting shadows, perhaps implying the state of mind also affects external reality.
