The most memorable recess I’ve ever had in AC was the “Virus Recess”.

For those of you who know what “Virus” is, you would be aware that it involves a lot of running. It is a game only primary schoolers partake in. For those who don’t, it essentially is a modified game of tagging. Depending on the group size, one or two people are the “virus” and they are meant to spread the “virus” by tagging others who must avoid getting the “virus” by not getting tagged.

With this context, had you walked past the IB Block a few weeks ago, you may have been quite surprised or confused to see a group of forty to fifty Year Sixes, apparently the most mature students in the school, running around the campus and hiding behind pillars, playing a game that even the youngest in the school, the Year Ones or Twos, wouldn’t even think of playing.

A casual canteen conversation resulted in playing games we used to play in our childhood.

During that recess, my friend and I were hiding behind one of the pillars when suddenly, a group of Year One boys walked past our hiding spot. To be honest, that moment was scary. Really scary. The two of us had already run so hard to avoid being caught. The more important part was I had no more stamina to run further. We instinctively put our fingers to our lips, motioning desperately for them to be quiet. Thankfully, the Year One boys did not divulge our location.

I will never forget the feeling of childlike happiness I experienced while playing a simple game of ‘catching’ with my friends. Youth is meant to be fun. Don’t you agree?
