Mathematics Competition Team is a CCA that trains students for more than 20 mathematics competitions annually.Â  Our members have obtained top awards in Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, Singapore Mathematical Olympiads, Australian Mathematics Competitions, American Mathematics Contests, British Mathematics Olympiads and hundreds of awards in other international competitions. Capable and committed members are groomed for leadership positions within the Executive Committee. Executive Committee members will have opportunities to train others and design the ACS(I) Inter-Class Mathematics Challenge. Based on their sterling performances in competitions, our alumni members have gained entry into Ivy League Universities across the globe.
