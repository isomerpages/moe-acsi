The science department realises that we do have a huge pool of talent among our students, who excel in other areas of science outside the academic curriculum.  These are students who enjoy participating in olympiads, science competitions and science fairs.  For this, we have the Science Research Challenge to help groom these talents.  For more information, please visit their [website](/src/).
