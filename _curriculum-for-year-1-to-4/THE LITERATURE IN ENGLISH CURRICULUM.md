 **INTRODUCTION**

The Literature in English curriculum offered at ACS (Independent) to the students in the Express Stream takes reference from the syllabus prescribed by the Ministry of Education. The details of the syllabus can be found at this link:

[https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2021syllabus/2065\_y21\_sy.pdf](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/olevel/2021syllabus/2065_y21_sy.pdf)

As mentioned in the syllabus document, here at ACS (Independent) we share the belief that the study of Literature empowers learners to make meaning of texts, and see themselves and the world from diverse perspectives.

**LEARNING OUTCOMES**

As spelled out in the MOE syllabus document: In the 21st century, more jobs will increasingly become outmoded by the presence and development of automation and smart technologies. Those who wish to remain relevant would be the ones who can accomplish what machine thinking cannot: developing novel solutions for unpredictable problems by thinking critically and creatively, seeing connections among seemingly unrelated phenomena and drawing links between global and local issues.  Literature is taught with the following critical considerations: ethical, aesthetic and intellectual and the desired outcomes of the literature programme include the development of:

*   Empathetic and Global Thinkers
*   Critical Readers
*   Creative Meaning-makers
*   Convincing Communicators

 **COURSE OUTLINE**

The Literary Response Framework consists of the following:

*   Literary Text at the Centre
*   Five Areas of Study: Plot, Character, Setting and Atmosphere, Style and Theme
*   Responding through Dialogue and Writing
*   Lenses: Experiencing Story, Appreciating Style and Interpreting Theme
*   Connections: Self, The World, Other Readers, Other Texts

 **ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES**

Students will be assessed on their ability to:

*   Demonstrate, through close analysis, knowledge of the literary texts studied;
*   Respond with knowledge and understanding to literary texts from a variety of genres, such as Prose, Poetry and Drama;
*   Demonstrate understanding of the ways in which writers’ choices of form, structure and language shape meanings;
*   Communicate a sensitive and informed personal response to what is read, and express responses clearly and coherently, using textual evidence where appropriate

The above assessment objectives are inter-related. Students’ responses will be assessed holistically on the attainment of these assessment objectives in an integrated and meaningful way.

**TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACHES**

At ACS (Independent), we align our beliefs with MOE in that a teacher of Literature is not a dispenser of knowledge but **a facilitator of learning.** The teachers gradually transfer the ownership of learning to students, empowering them to be active participants in shaping their own meaning-making.

The **four Principles** of Literature Teaching and Learning are:

1.  Personal Engagement
2.  Meaningful Connections
3.  Critical Appreciation
4.  Reflective Practice

These Principles are **interconnected** and are to be enacted in an **integrated manner.**
