**INTRODUCTION**

The Language Arts Programme is a **preparatory course of study** for students who will be offering English A as the Group 1 subject at the IBDP level.  Designed by teachers of the school, the programme aims to prepare students for the demands of the subject. As such, most of its assessment methods are modelled after the English A syllabus but adjusted in response to age appropriate learning needs of the younger students.  The programme endeavours to develop a competent, critical and compassionate **reader and writer** who is aware of the function and nuances of the English Language in its varied functional and cultural contexts and is able to use it effectively in any communicative situation.  The syllabus also takes reference from the MOE EL and Literature syllabi for secondary schools and share in the commitment to develop 21st Century competencies in our students, especially in terms of developing Language and communicative skills, to a more sophisticated level.

Literary concerns and issues will be introduced at the Year 1 level, and they will be explored in greater detail incrementally throughout the course of study. The **spiralling curriculum** aims to develop student’s understanding in terms of breadth as well as depth.  Concurrently, the curriculum will also focus on the student’s acquisition of competent communicative skills in the areas of reading and writing, listening and speaking. **Critical thinking**, **National Education** and **Affective Education** will also be constantly brought to the fore during the teaching of the syllabus. In addition, the course introduces students to the attributes of the IB learner profile which promote academic rigour, self-directed learning and the establishing of a personal value system leading to international mindedness. Apart from offering opportunities for creative and discursive writing, the genres of text encourage the development of close analysis, empathy and critical appreciation.

The subject is concerned with the students’ conceptions, interpretations and experiences of the world through the texts. The teaching of the functional aspects of the language is done with the intention of giving students a tool with which they can use to articulate all the complex pursuits, anxieties, joys and fears that human beings are exposed to in the daily business of living in the 21st Century. As competent users of the language, students will be better able to develop a healthy respect for the imagination, and through that take a perceptive approach to the understanding and interpretation of literary works.

#### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, learners should be able to:

*   develop an understanding of the concept of text types as an **Empathetic and Global Thinker** so as to understand the purpose of communication in context and to be able to use language in an appropriate manner, demonstrated in speech and writing

**TEACHING AND LEARNING APPROACHES**

Adopting a **spiral** curriculum design; the syllabus revisits the breadth of literary and language skills taught in previous years for added depth and skill mastery in an age-appropriate manner. The approaches to teaching Language Arts apply strategies borrowed from both the Language and Literature classrooms; adopting a set of inquiry-based  principles. Learners are encouraged to **experience the story** for **personal engagement** and to make **meaningful connections** through dialogue and inquiry. The Language Arts classroom is **interactive**, focused on the learner’s development of **critical appreciation.** 

With the guidance of the teacher, learners navigate and **discover** new meaning and connections, and they are given opportunities for **application** and **reflection** to facilitate strong consolidation of learning. The art of information management and audience-engagement are reinforced at all stages of learning with increased sophistication.

The assessment tasks are designed to prioritize formative learning, whilst capturing and recognising the learning outcomes. The emphasis on learning from the process helps students cultivate an interest in the subject. The ultimate goal is for students to develop empathy and discernment by building up self-awareness and honing their ability to manage diverse perspectives.  Media and digital literacy are meaningfully integrated into the assessment tasks to ensure that students are keenly aware of the possibilities and pitfalls of technologically-enabled communication.
